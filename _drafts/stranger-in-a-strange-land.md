# Chapter XIV

> IN THE VOLANT LAND OF LAPUTA, according to the journal of Lemuel Gulliver recounting his Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World, no person of importance ever listened or spoke without the help of a servant, known as a "climenole" in Laputian-or "flapper" in rough English translation, as such a Servant's only duty was to flap the mouth and ears of his master with a dried bladder whenever, in the opinion of the servant, it was desirable for his master to speak or listen. 
> ...
> But at the time the Federation Ship Champion returned to Terra from Mars, the "flapper system" had been expanding for more than a century and had reached a stage of great intricacy, with many persons employed solely in carrying out its rituals. The importance of a public personage could be estimated by the number of layers of flappers cutting him off from ready congress with the plebian mob. They were not called "flappers," but were known as executive assistants, private secretaries, secretaries to private secretaries, press secretaries, receptionists, appointment clerks, et cetera. In fact the titles could be anything-or (with some of the most puissant) no title at all, but they could all be identified as "flappers" by function: each one held arbitrary and concatenative veto over any attempted communication from the outside world to the Great Man who was the nominal superior of the flapper. 

This is a great description of the modern bureaucracy.
I've learned a lot from this. I believe I was aware in the back of my mind that such a "flapper" system is ubiquitous in all areas of our society, especially in academia, this is the first time that I've seen it described so clearly.
I was also impressed how Jubal Harshaw was able to cut through the "flapper" system (by getting hold of the chief astrologer of the wife of the president) and get to the president himself.
I tend to do things by the book, and just reading this story taught me a lot. WHAT EXACTLY?

# Chapter XV
> As soon as he was sure that he was at the deepest part, he curled himself into the foetal position, let most of the air out of his lungs, swallowed his tongue, rolled his eyes up, slowed his heart down to almost nothing, and became effectively "dead" save that he was not actually discorporate and could start his engines again at will. (Chapter XV)
 
I wonder whether Heinlein refers to the [Khecari mudra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khecarī_mudrā) here, which is a yogic practice of rolling the tongue back into the throat. 
Also, the prolonged suspension of breath is called (Kumbhaka)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumbhaka] in Kriya Yoga.
