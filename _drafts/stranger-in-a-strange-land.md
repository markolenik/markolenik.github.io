> As soon as he was sure that he was at the deepest part, he curled himself into the foetal position, let most of the air out of his lungs, swallowed his tongue, rolled his eyes up, slowed his heart down to almost nothing, and became effectively "dead" save that he was not actually discorporate and could start his engines again at will. (Chapter XV)
 
I wonder whether Heinlein refers to the [Khecari mudra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khecarī_mudrā) here, which is a yogic practice of rolling the tongue back into the throat. 
Also, the prolonged suspension of breath is called (Kumbhaka)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumbhaka] in Kriya Yoga.
