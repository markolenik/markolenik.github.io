It is argued that the statistical analysis of such data has proved difficult because of a lack both of concepts of independence and of rich enough parametric classes of distributions in the simplex. A variety of independence hypotheses are introduced and interrelated, and new classes of transformed-normal distributions in the simplex are provided as models within which the independence hypotheses can be tested through standard theory of parametric hypothesis testing. The new concepts and statistical methodology are illustrated by a number of applications.},

  abstract = {Robustness is an essential feature of biological systems, and any mathematical model that describes such a system should reflect this feature. Especially, persistence of oscillatory behavior is an important issue. A benchmark model for this phenomenon is the Laub-Loomis model, a nonlinear model for cAMP oscillations in Dictyostelium discoideum. This model captures the most important features of biomolecular networks oscillating at constant frequencies. Nevertheless, the robustness of its oscillatory behavior is not yet fully understood. Given a system that exhibits oscillating behavior for some set of parameters, the central question of robustness is how far the parameters may be changed, such that the qualitative behavior does not change. The determination of such a “robustness region” in parameter space is an intricate task. If the number of parameters is high, it may be also time consuming. In the literature, several methods are proposed that partially tackle this problem. For example, some methods only detect particular bifurcations, or only find a relatively small box-shaped estimate for an irregularly shaped robustness region. Here, we present an approach that is much more general, and is especially designed to be efficient for systems with a large number of parameters. As an illustration, we apply the method first to a well understood low-dimensional system, the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model. This is a predator-prey model featuring satiation of the predator. It has only two parameters and its bifurcation diagram is available in the literature. We find a good agreement with the existing knowledge about this model. When we apply the new method to the high dimensional Laub-Loomis model, we obtain a much larger robustness region than reported earlier in the literature. This clearly demonstrates the power of our method. From the results, we conclude that the biological system underlying is much more robust than was realized until now.},

Several methods that integrate methylation, gene expression, and protein quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with GWAS data to determine their causal role in the path from genotype to phenotype have been proposed. Here, we developed and applied a multi-omics Mendelian randomization (MR) framework to study how metabolites mediate the effect of gene expression on complex traits. We identified 216 transcript-metabolite-trait causal triplets involving 26 medically relevant phenotypes. Among these associations, 58\% were missed by classical transcriptome-wide MR, which only uses gene expression and GWAS data. This allowed the identification of biologically relevant pathways, such as between ANKH and calcium levels mediated by citrate levels and SLC6A12 and serum creatinine through modulation of the levels of the renal osmolyte betaine. We show that the signals missed by transcriptome-wide MR are found, thanks to the increase in power conferred by integrating multiple omics layer. Simulation analyses show that with larger molecular QTL studies and in case of mediated effects, our multi-omics MR framework outperforms classical MR approaches designed to detect causal relationships between single molecular traits and complex phenotypes.},

We combined analytical and machine learning tools to describe the aging process in large sets of longitudinal measurements. Assuming that aging results from a dynamic instability of the organism state, we designed a deep artificial neural network, including auto-encoder and auto-regression (AR) components. The AR model tied the dynamics of physiological state with the stochastic evolution of a single variable, the “dynamic frailty indicator” (dFI). In a subset of blood tests from the Mouse Phenome Database, dFI increased exponentially and predicted the remaining lifespan. The observation of the limiting dFI was consistent with the late-life mortality deceleration. dFI changed along with hallmarks of aging, including frailty index, molecular markers of inflammation, senescent cell accumulation, and responded to life-shortening (high-fat diet) and life-extending (rapamycin) treatments.},

  abstract = {Aging is determined by complex interactions among genetic and environmental factors. Increasing evidence suggests that the gut microbiome lies at the core of many age-associated changes, including immune system dysregulation and susceptibility to diseases. The gut microbiota undergoes extensive changes across the lifespan, and age-related processes may influence the gut microbiota and its related metabolic alterations. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the current literature on aging-associated alterations in diversity, composition, and functional features of the gut microbiota. We identified 27 empirical human studies of normal and successful aging suitable for inclusion. Alpha diversity of microbial taxa, functional pathways, and metabolites was higher in older adults, particularly among the oldest-old adults, compared to younger individuals. Beta diversity distances significantly differed across various developmental stages and were different even between oldest-old and younger-old adults. Differences in taxonomic composition and functional potential varied across studies, but Akkermansia was most consistently reported to be relatively more abundant with aging, whereas Faecalibacterium, Bacteroidaceae, and Lachnospiraceae were relatively reduced. Older adults have reduced pathways related to carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid synthesis; however, oldest-old adults exhibited functional differences that distinguished their microbiota from that of young-old adults, such as greater potential for short-chain fatty acid production and increased butyrate derivatives. Although a definitive interpretation is limited by the cross-sectional design of published reports, we integrated findings of microbial composition and downstream functional pathways and metabolites, offering possible explanations regarding age-related processes.},

  abstract = {Author summary We present a detailed analysis of the Active Vertex Model to study the mechanics of confluent epithelial tissues and cell monolayers. The model combines the commonly used Vertex Model for describing epithelial tissue mechanics with the active matter dynamics extensively studied in soft matter physics. We utlise an exact mathematical mapping that enables a very efficient numerical implementation using standard methods for simulating particle-based models. System sizes accessible to this model allow us to probe the dynamical motion patterns that occur in tissues over a range of length- and time-scales previously inaccessible to available simulation tools. Our model also includes a number of essential features required to properly describe actual biological systems such as cell growth, cell division and aptotsis, as well as the dynamic boundary of the epithelial sheet. This allows us to study phenomena such as the finger-like protrusions in cell monolayers and processes related to wound healing. The model is implemented into the SAMoS simulation software package and is publically available under a non-restrictive open source licence.},

  abstract = {Background:. Measures to quantify changes in the pace of biological aging in response to intervention are needed to evaluate geroprotective interventions for humans. Previously, we showed that quantification of the pace of biological aging from a DNA-methylation blood test was possible (Belsky et al., 2020). Here, we report a next-generation DNA-methylation biomarker of Pace of Aging, DunedinPACE (for Pace of Aging Calculated from the Epigenome). Methods:. We used data from the Dunedin Study 1972–1973 birth cohort tracking within-individual decline in 19 indicators of organ-system integrity across four time points spanning two decades to model Pace of Aging. We distilled this two-decade Pace of Aging into a single-time-point DNA-methylation blood-test using elastic-net regression and a DNA-methylation dataset restricted to exclude probes with low test-retest reliability. We evaluated the resulting measure, named DunedinPACE, in five additional datasets. Results:. DunedinPACE showed high test-retest reliability, was associated with morbidity, disability, and mortality, and indicated faster aging in young adults with childhood adversity. DunedinPACE effect-sizes were similar to GrimAge Clock effect-sizes. In analysis of incident morbidity, disability, and mortality, DunedinPACE and added incremental prediction beyond GrimAge. Conclusions:. DunedinPACE is a novel blood biomarker of the pace of aging for gerontology and geroscience. Funding:. This research was supported by US-National Institute on Aging grants AG032282, AG061378, AG066887, and UK Medical Research Council grant MR/P005918/1.},

Here we develop numerical and theoretical models to calculate energy barriers to cell rearrangements, which help govern cell migration in cell monolayers. In contrast to work on sheared foams, we find that energy barrier heights are exponentially distributed and depend systematically on the cell's number of neighbors. Based on these results, we predict glassy two-time correlation functions for cell motion, with a timescale that increases rapidly as cell activity decreases. These correlation functions are used to construct simple random walks that reproduce the caging behavior observed for cell trajectories in experiments. This work provides a theoretical framework for predicting collective motion of cells in wound-healing, embryogenesis and cancer tumorogenesis.},

  abstract = {Human gut microbial dynamics are highly individualized, making it challenging to link microbiota to health and to design universal microbiome therapies. This individuality is typically attributed to variation in host genetics, diets, environments and medications but it could also emerge from fundamental ecological forces that shape microbiota more generally. Here, we leverage extensive gut microbial time series from wild baboons—hosts who experience little interindividual dietary and environmental heterogeneity—to test whether gut microbial dynamics are synchronized across hosts or largely idiosyncratic. Despite their shared lifestyles, baboon microbiota were only weakly synchronized. The strongest synchrony occurred among baboons living in the same social group, probably because group members range over the same habitat and simultaneously encounter the same sources of food and water. However, this synchrony was modest compared to each host’s personalized dynamics. In support, host-specific factors, especially host identity, explained, on average, more than three times the deviance in longitudinal dynamics compared to factors shared with social group members and ten times the deviance of factors shared across the host population. These results contribute to mounting evidence that highly idiosyncratic gut microbiomes are not an artefact of modern human environments and that synchronizing forces in the gut microbiome (for example, shared environments, diets and microbial dispersal) are not strong enough to overwhelm key drivers of microbiome personalization, such as host genetics, priority effects, horizontal gene transfer and functional redundancy.},

  abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

  abstract = {The ability to predict human phenotypes and identify biomarkers of disease from metagenomic data is crucial for the development of therapeutics for microbiome-associated diseases. However, metagenomic data is commonly affected by technical variables unrelated to the phenotype of interest, such as sequencing protocol, which can make it difficult to predict phenotype and find biomarkers of disease. Supervised methods to correct for background noise, originally designed for gene expression and RNA-seq data, are commonly applied to microbiome data but may be limited because they cannot account for unmeasured sources of variation. Unsupervised approaches address this issue, but current methods are limited because they are ill-equipped to deal with the unique aspects of microbiome data, which is compositional, highly skewed, and sparse. We perform a comparative analysis of the ability of different denoising transformations in combination with supervised correction methods as well as an unsupervised principal component correction approach that is presently used in other domains but has not been applied to microbiome data to date. We find that the unsupervised principal component correction approach has comparable ability in reducing false discovery of biomarkers as the supervised approaches, with the added benefit of not needing to know the sources of variation apriori. However, in prediction tasks, it appears to only improve prediction when technical variables contribute to the majority of variance in the data. As new and larger metagenomic datasets become increasingly available, background noise correction will become essential for generating reproducible microbiome analyses.},

Here we describe methods for within-family Mendelian randomization analyses and use simulation studies to show that family-based analyses can reduce such biases. We illustrate empirically how familial effects can affect estimates using data from 61,008 siblings from the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study and UK Biobank and replicated our findings using 222,368 siblings from 23andMe. Both Mendelian randomization estimates using unrelated individuals and within family methods reproduced established effects of lower BMI reducing risk of diabetes and high blood pressure. However, while Mendelian randomization estimates from samples of unrelated individuals suggested that taller height and lower BMI increase educational attainment, these effects were strongly attenuated in within-family Mendelian randomization analyses. Our findings indicate the necessity of controlling for population structure and familial effects in Mendelian randomization studies.},

  abstract = {The intestinal microbiota plays important roles in digestion and resistance against entero-pathogens. As with other ecosystems, its species composition is resilient against small disturbances but strong perturbations such as antibiotics can affect the consortium dramatically. Antibiotic cessation does not necessarily restore pre-treatment conditions and disturbed microbiota are often susceptible to pathogen invasion. Here we propose a mathematical model to explain how antibioticmediated switches in the microbiota composition can result from simple social interactions between antibiotic-tolerant and antibiotic-sensitive bacterial groups. We build a two-species (e.g. two functional-groups) model and identify regions of domination by antibiotic-sensitive or antibiotic-tolerant bacteria, as well as a region of multistability where domination by either group is possible. Using a new framework that we derived from statistical physics, we calculate the duration of each microbiota composition state. This is shown to depend on the balance between random fluctuations in the bacterial densities and the strength of microbial interactions. The singular value decomposition of recent metagenomic data confirms our assumption of grouping microbes as antibiotic-tolerant or antibiotic-sensitive in response to a single antibiotic. Our methodology can be extended to multiple bacterial groups and thus it provides an ecological formalism to help interpret the present surge in microbiome data.},

We review the current state-of-the-art in bioreactor modeling and current efforts in modeling the intestinal microbiota. Mathematical modeling could benefit greatly from the deluge of data emerging from metagenomic studies, but data-driven approaches such as network inference that aim to predict microbiome dynamics without explicit mechanistic knowledge seem better suited to model these data. Finally, we discuss how the integration of microbiome shotgun sequencing and metabolic modeling approaches such as flux balance analysis may fulfill the promise of a mechanistic model of the intestinal microbiota.},

The processes that drive such inter-individual variation are not well understood. To address this, we surveyed the microbial communities associated with the intestine of the zebrafish, Danio rerio, over developmental time. We compared our observations of community composition and distribution across hosts with that predicted by a neutral assembly model, which assumes that community assembly is driven solely by chance and dispersal. We found that as hosts develop from larvae to adults, the fit of the model to observed microbial distributions decreases, suggesting that the relative importance of non-neutral processes, such as microbe-microbe interactions, active dispersal, or selection by the host, increases as hosts mature. We also observed that taxa which depart in their distributions from the neutral prediction form ecologically distinct sub-groups, which are phylogenetically clustered with respect to the full metacommunity. These results demonstrate that neutral processes are sufficient to generate substantial variation in microbiota composition across individual hosts, and suggest that potentially unique or important taxa may be identified by their divergence from neutral distributions.},

  abstract = {Random forests are one of the state-of-the-art supervised machine learning methods and achieve good performance in high-dimensional settings where p, the number of predictors, is much larger than n, the number of observations. Repeated measurements provide, in general, additional information, hence they are worth accounted especially when analyzing high-dimensional data. Tree-based methods have already been adapted to clustered and longitudinal data by using a semi-parametric mixed effects model, in which the non-parametric part is estimated using regression trees or random forests. We propose a general approach of random forests for high-dimensional longitudinal data. It includes a flexible stochastic model which allows the covariance structure to vary over time. Furthermore, we introduce a new method which takes intra-individual covariance into consideration to build random forests. Through simulation experiments, we then study the behavior of different estimation methods, especially in the context of high-dimensional data. Finally, the proposed method has been applied to an HIV vaccine trial including 17 HIV-infected patients with 10 repeated measurements of 20,000 gene transcripts and blood concentration of human immunodeficiency virus RNA. The approach selected 21 gene transcripts for which the association with HIV viral load was fully relevant and consistent with results observed during primary infection.},

  abstract = {The expression microarray is a frequently used approach to study gene expression on a genome-wide scale. However, the data produced by the thousands of microarray studies published annually are confounded by “batch effects,” the systematic error introduced when samples are processed in multiple batches. Although batch effects can be reduced by careful experimental design, they cannot be eliminated unless the whole study is done in a single batch. A number of programs are now available to adjust microarray data for batch effects prior to analysis. We systematically evaluated six of these programs using multiple measures of precision, accuracy and overall performance. ComBat, an Empirical Bayes method, outperformed the other five programs by most metrics. We also showed that it is essential to standardize expression data at the probe level when testing for correlation of expression profiles, due to a sizeable probe effect in microarray data that can inflate the correlation among replicates and unrelated samples.},

Methods to enumerate immune subsets such as immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry suffer from limitations in phenotypic markers and can be challenging to practically implement and standardize. An alternative approach is to acquire aggregative high dimensional data from cellular mixtures and to subsequently infer the cellular components computationally. We recently described CIBERSORT, a versatile computational method for quantifying cell fractions from bulk tissue gene expression profiles (GEPs). Combining support vector regression with prior knowledge of expression profiles from purified leukocyte subsets, CIBERSORT can accurately estimate the immune composition of a tumor biopsy. In this chapter, we provide a primer on the CIBERSORT method and illustrate its use for characterizing TILs in tumor samples profiled by microarray or RNA-Seq.},

The problem comprises an invader and a protector that both operate on a network with a number of possible source-destination paths. The protector aims at allocating security resources on the network such that the invader's path is detected with high probability. The invader's choice of path is known to the protector in terms of a probability distribution reflecting the protector's beliefs. Errors in these beliefs induce the risk of a low detection probability. We derive a linear programming approximation and leverage the theory of coherent risk measures to consider risk-aversion with respect to errors in the protector's beliefs. The performance of the resulting risk-averse detection policy is numerically compared with the performance of the risk-neutral policy. We show that the risk-averse policy significantly mitigates the risk of facing a low detection probability in the presence of large errors in the protector's beliefs.},

In previous work focusing on experimental and IFB model responses to sinusoidal current injection, large regions of stimulus parameter space were observed for which the response was entrained to periodic applied current, resulting in repetitive burst, tonic, or mixed (i.e., burst followed by tonic) responses. Here we present an exact analysis of such mode-locking in the integrate-and-fire-or-burst model under the influence of arbitrary periodic forcing that includes sinusoidally driven responses as one case. In this analysis, the instabilities of mode-locked states are identified as both smooth bifurcations of an associated firing time map and nonsmooth bifurcations of the underlying discontinuous flow. The explicit construction of borders in parameter space that define the instabilities of mode-locked zones is used to build up the Arnol'd tongue structure for the model. The zones for mode-locking are shown to be in excellent agreement with numerical simulations and are used to explore the observed stimulus dependence of burst versus tonic response of the IFB neuron model.},

In this paper we consider networks of IFB neurons with slow synaptic interactions and show how the dynamics may be described with a smooth firing-rate model. When the firing rate of the IFB model is dominated by a refractory process the equations of motion simplify and may be solved exactly. Numerical simulations are used to show that a pair of reciprocally interacting inhibitory spiking IFB TC neurons supports an alternating rhythm of the type predicted from the firing-rate theory. A change in a single parameter of the IFB neuron allows it to fire a burst of spikes in response to a depolarizing signal, so that it mimics the behavior of a reticular (RE) cell. Within a continuum model we show that a network of RE cells with on-center excitation can support a fast traveling pulse. In contrast, a network of inhibitory TC cells is found to support a slowly propagating lurching pulse.},

  abstract = {Rhythmic activity within the heartbeat pattern generator of the medicinal leech is based on the alternating bursting of mutually inhibitory pairs of oscillator heart interneurons (half-center oscillators). Bicuculline methiodide has been shown to block mutual inhibition between these interneurons and to cause them to spike tonically while recorded intracellularly (Schmidt and Calabrese, 1992). Using extracellular recording techniques, we show here that oscillator and premotor heart interneurons continue to burst when pharmacologically isolated with bicuculline, although the bursting is not robust in some preparations. We propose that a nonspecific leak current introduced by the intracellular microelectrode suppresses endogenous bursting activity to account for the discrepancy with results using intracellular recording. A two-parameter bifurcation diagram (E leak vsg leak) of a mathematical model of a single heart interneuron shows a narrow stripe of parameter values where bursting occurs, separating large zones of tonic spiking and silence. A similar analysis performed for a half-center oscillator model outlined a much larger area of bursting. Bursting in the half-center oscillator model is also less sensitive to variation in the maximal conductances of voltage-gated currents than in the single-neuron model. Thus, in addition to ensuring appropriate bursting characteristics such as period, phase, and duty cycles, the half-center configuration enhances oscillation robustness, making them less susceptible to random or imposed changes in membrane parameters. Endogenous bursting, in turn, ensures appropriate bursting if the strength of mutual inhibition is weakened and limits the minimum period of the half-center oscillator to a period near that of the single neuron.},

  abstract = {The emergence of epigenetic predictors was a pivotal moment in geroscience, propelling the measurement and concept of biological ageing into a quantitative era. However, while current epigenetic clocks have shown strong predictive power, they do not reflect the underlying biological mechanisms driving methylation changes with age. Consequently, biological interpretation of their estimates is limited. Furthermore, our findings suggest that clocks trained on chronological age are confounded by non-age-related phenomena. To address these limitations, we developed a probabilistic model that describes methylation transitions at the cellular level. Our approach reveals two measurable components, acceleration and bias, that directly relate to perturbations of the underlying cellular dynamics. Acceleration is the proportional increase in the speed of methylation transitions across CpG sites, whereas bias is the degree of global change in methylation affecting all CpG sites uniformly. Using data from 7,028 participants from the Generation Scotland study, we found the age acceleration parameter to be associated with physiological traits known to impact healthy ageing. Furthermore, a genome-wide association study of age acceleration identified four genomic loci previously linked with ageing.},

  abstract = {Metagenomic sequencing techniques enable quantitative analyses of the microbiome. However, combining the microbial data from these experiments is challenging due to the variations between experiments. The existing methods for correcting batch effects do not consider the interactions between variables—microbial taxa in microbial studies—and the overdispersion of the microbiome data. Therefore, they are not applicable to microbiome data.We develop a new method, Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial regression meta-analysis (BDMMA), to simultaneously model the batch effects and detect the microbial taxa associated with phenotypes. BDMMA automatically models the dependence among microbial taxa and is robust to the high dimensionality of the microbiome and their association sparsity. Simulation studies and real data analysis show that BDMMA can successfully adjust batch effects and substantially reduce false discoveries in microbial meta-analyses.An R package” BDMMA” for Windows and Linux is available at https://github.com/DAIZHENWEI/BDMMA/BDMMA, and a version for MacOS is provided at https://github.com/DAIZHENWEI/BDMMA/BDMMA\_MacOS.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {The mechanism of reciprocal inhibition between antagonistic motor centres during swimming in the paralysed Xenopus embryo has been investigated further. Paired intracellular recordings have been made from interneurones and motoneurones in an attempt to identify neurones which make direct inhibitory synapses onto motoneurones on the opposite side of the spinal cord. A physiological class of inhibitory interneurones is described which, when stimulated by intracellular current passage, evoke short-latency, probably monosynaptic, strychnine-sensitive inhibitory potentials in contralateral motoneurones. These inhibitory interneurones fire once per swimming cycle in phase with the ipsilateral motor root discharge. They therefore have a pattern of activity which would cause them to inhibit motoneurones of the antagonistic motor centre at an appropriate part of the swimming cycle. The intracellular injection of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) has allowed the morphology of these inhibitory interneurones to be characterized. They have unipolar cell bodies with a thick proximal process with short dendrites which crosses the spinal cord ventrally and then bifurcates with one axonal branch ascending into the hind brain and the other descending the spinal cord. These anatomical features are typical of the 'commissural interneurones' first described by Roberts \& Clarke (1982). There are also some inhibitory interneurones which can inhibit motoneurones on the same side of the spinal cord. At least some of these interneurones may be commissural interneurones with ipsilateral axons and they may play a role in the generation of the swimming rhythm.},

  abstract = {1. Neurons from the Xenopus embryo spinal cord were dissociated and conventional patch clamp techniques were used to record the whole-cell currents in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX). 2. The outward currents of the acutely isolated spinal neurons were rapidly reduced to about half their control value by substitution of extracellular Na+ with N-methyl-D-glucamine, lysine or choline. 3. The use of Li+ as a Na+ substitute partially reduced the outward currents. 4. The reversal potential of the Na(+)-sensitive current was close to the K+ equilibrium potential and could be altered by changing extracellular K+. The Na(+)-sensitive current was therefore a K+ current. 5. The Na(+)-sensitive K+ current was voltage dependent and activated in a sustained manner and appeared very similar to the delayed rectifier present in these neurons. 6. While the Na(+)-sensitive current increased with voltage as might be expected for an outward current, at very positive potentials it progressively decreased in amplitude. The voltage range over which this decrease was present moved closer to zero as the levels of intracellular Na+ were increased. The tail currents evoked by positive test potentials did not correspondingly decrease in amplitude, suggesting that channel block was rapidly relieved by stepping back to the holding potential. 7. Intracellular perfusion of the patch pipette with solutions containing varying amounts of Na+ (0-20 mM) showed that the K+ currents could be increased in a dose-dependent manner by raising intracellular Na+. The current had an EC50 for Na+ of 7.3 mM and a Hill coefficient of 4.6. 8. Single channel recordings from isolated inside-out patches revealed a channel that gated more frequently when the bathing levels of Na+ were elevated from 3 to 12 or 50 mM. Xenopus spinal cord neurons therefore possess a current that is not only voltage dependent but is also sensitive to internal Na+. 9. Xenopus spinal neurons possess a transient Na+ current (blocked by the inclusion of TTX) and a leak channel permeable to Na+. The inward leakage of Na+ appeared to provide the Na+ necessary for the gating of the Na(+)-dependent channel. 10. Blocking the Na(+)-K+ exchange pumps by removing extracellular K+, reduced the effect of removal of external Na+, suggesting that the Na(+)-K+ exchange pumps could be important in controlling the submembrane Na+.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

In particular, it is shown that for critical choices of parameter values, commonly used physical models of rigid or compliant mechanical contact, capillary adhesion, and cell division satisfy the conditions required by the general framework. The paper relies on the well-known discontinuity-mapping formalism. In contrast to previous treatments, the proposed abstract framework more clearly establishes the origin of the large state-space stretching in the initial (and possibly only) step of the construction of a discontinuity mapping. It further highlights the nonuniqueness in the formulation of the discontinuity mapping and its connection to the choice of a locally smooth map with which the discontinuity mapping is composed to describe the near-grazing dynamics. The analysis is illustrated with examples from tapping-mode atomic force microscopy in the presence of thin fluid layers on the sample and the probe tip and from the study of protein activity during a eukaryotic cell cycle.},

  abstract = {Central pattern generators (CPGs) consisting of interacting groups of neurons drive a variety of repetitive, rhythmic behaviors in invertebrates and vertebrates, such as arise in locomotion, respiration, mastication, scratching, and so on. These CPGs are able to generate rhythmic activity in the absence of afferent feedback or rhythmic inputs. However, functionally relevant CPGs must adaptively respond to changing demands, manifested as changes in oscillation period or in relative phase durations in response to variations in non-patterned inputs or drives. Although many half-center CPG models, composed of symmetric units linked by reciprocal inhibition yet varying in their intrinsic cellular properties, have been proposed, the precise oscillatory mechanisms operating in most biological CPGs remain unknown. Using numerical simulations and phase-plane analysis, we comparatively investigated how the intrinsic cellular features incorporated in different CPG models, such as subthreshold activation based on a slowly inactivating persistent sodium current, adaptation based on slowly activating calcium-dependent potassium current, or post-inhibitory rebound excitation, can contribute to the control of oscillation period and phase durations in response to changes in excitatory external drive to one or both half-centers. Our analysis shows that both the sensitivity of oscillation period to alterations of excitatory drive and the degree to which the duration of each phase can be separately controlled depend strongly on the intrinsic cellular mechanisms involved in rhythm generation and phase transitions. In particular, the CPG formed from units incorporating a slowly inactivating persistent sodium current shows the greatest range of oscillation periods and the greatest degree of independence in phase duration control by asymmetric inputs. These results are explained based on geometric analysis of the phase plane structures corresponding to the dynamics for each CPG type, which in particular helps pinpoint the roles of escape and release from synaptic inhibition in the effects we find.},

Adding a fourth compartment to represent the shaft of the primary dendrite gives a substantial improvement. The reduced models exhibit behaviours in common with the full model which were not used in fitting the model parameters. The reduced models run 75 or more times faster than the full model, making their use in large, realistic network models of the olfactory bulb practical.},

  abstract = {Computational neuroscience has produced a diversity of software for simulations of networks of spiking neurons, with both negative and positive consequences. On the one hand, each simulator uses its own programming or configuration language, leading to considerable difficulty in porting models from one simulator to another. This impedes communication between investigators and makes it harder to reproduce and build on the work of others. On the other hand, simulation results can be cross-checked between different simulators, giving greater confidence in their correctness, and each simulator has different optimizations, so the most appropriate simulator can be chosen for a given modelling task. A common programming interface to multiple simulators would reduce or eliminate the problems of simulator diversity while retaining the benefits. PyNN is such an interface, making it possible to write a simulation script once, using the Python programming language, and run it without modification on any supported simulator (currently NEURON, NEST, PCSIM, Brian and the Heidelberg VLSI neuromorphic hardware). PyNN increases the productivity of neuronal network modelling by providing high-level abstraction, by promoting code sharing and reuse, and by providing a foundation for simulator-agnostic analysis, visualization and data-management tools. PyNN increases the reliability of modelling studies by making it much easier to check results on multiple simulators.

Both motor patterns displayed left-right alternation. The first pattern was characterized by cycle periods ranging between 2.4 and 9.0 s (4.9 ± 1.2 s, mean ± SD) and a rostrocaudal propagation of the activity in consecutive ventral roots. The second pattern displayed longer cycle periods (8.1–28.3 s; 14.2 ± 3.6 s) with a caudorostral propagation. The two patterns were inducible after a spinal transection at the first segment. Preliminary experiments on small pieces of spinal cord further suggested that the ability for rhythm generation is distributed along the spinal cord of this preparation. This study shows that the in vitro brain stem–spinal cord preparation fromPleurodeles waltl may be a useful model to study the mechanisms underlying the different axial motor patterns and the flexibility of the neural networks involved.},

As the developmental software runs, its sequence of events is reflected in shifting cellular epigenetic states. Overall, I suggest that to understand ageing we need to decode our software and the flow of epigenetic information throughout the life course.},

  abstract = {Working memory refers to the temporary retention of information that was just experienced or just retrieved from long-term memory but no longer exists in the external environment. These internal representations are short-lived, but can be stored for longer periods of time through active maintenance or rehearsal strategies, and can be subjected to various operations that manipulate the information in such a way that makes it useful for goal-directed behaviour. Empirical studies of working memory using neuroscientific techniques, such as neuronal recordings in monkeys or functional neuroimaging in humans, have advanced our knowledge of the underlying neural mechanisms of working memory. This rich dataset can be reconciled with behavioural findings derived from investigating the cognitive mechanisms underlying working memory. In this paper, I review the progress that has been made towards this effort by illustrating how investigations of the neural mechanisms underlying working memory can be influenced by cognitive models and, in turn, how cognitive models can be shaped and modified by neuroscientific data. One conclusion that arises from this research is that working memory can be viewed as neither a unitary nor a dedicated system. A network of brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC), is critical for the active maintenance of internal representations that are necessary for goal-directed behaviour. Thus, working memory is not localized to a single brain region but probably is an emergent property of the functional interactions between the PFC and the rest of the brain.},

This paper gives a survey of different types of MMOs, concentrating its analysis on MMOs whose small-amplitude oscillations are produced by a local, multiple-time-scale “mechanism.” Recent work gives substantially improved insight into the mathematical properties of these mechanisms. In this survey, we unify diverse observations about MMOs and establish a systematic framework for studying their properties.

Hodgkin-Huxley type kinetic models of ionic channels were derived from voltage- and current-clamp data from RE cells. Interactions between interconnected RE cells were simulated with the use of a kinetic model of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibitory synapses. 2. The intrinsic bursting properties of RE cells in the model were due to the presence of a low-threshold Ca2+ current and two Ca(2+)-activated currents. The properties of these model RE cells were compared with RE neurons recorded intracellularly in vivo in cats. 3. Model RE cells densely interconnected with GABAA synapses produced synchronous oscillations at a frequency close to that of spindles (7–14 Hz). Networks of RE neurons organized in a two-dimensional array with only proximal connectivity also exhibited synchronized oscillations in the spindle range. In addition, the proximally connected network showed periods of high and low synchronicity, giving rise to waxing and waning oscillations in the population of RE cells. 4. The spatiotemporal behavior of the network was investigated during waxing and waning oscillations. The waxing and waning emerged as an alternation between periods of desynchronized and synchronized activity, corresponding to periods of irregular and coherent spatial activity. During synchronized periods, the network displayed propagating coherent waves of synchronous activity that had a tendency to form spirals. 5. Networks of model RE neurons fully connected through GABAB synapses exhibited perfectly synchronous oscillations at lower frequencies (0.5–1 Hz), but two-dimensional networks with proximal GABAB connectivity failed to synchronize. 6. These simulations demonstrate that networks of model neurons that include the main intrinsic currents found in RE cells can generate waxing and waning oscillatory activity similar to the spindle rhythmicity observed in the isolated RE nucleus in vivo. The model reveals the interplay between the intrinsic rhythmic properties of RE cells and the fast synaptic interactions in organizing synchronized rhythmicity.},

Specifically, the pipeline implements a sparse dictionary learning to infer the most relevant Ca2+ patterns, an image segmentation procedure using a wavelet- transform and watershed to identify single cells, and an estimation of the transient signals by means of sparse coding exploiting spatial and temporal sparsity. We validate our automated approach on artificial and two different calcium imaging sequences from mice hippocampal slice cultures acquired with fluorescence and confocal microscopes. Our approach achieves ca. 94\% sensitivity on average for correctly detecting events, thus improving significantly the estimation of cell signals relative to published procedures.},

  abstract = {Joint interval scattergrams are usually employed in determining serial correlations between events of spike trains. However, any inherent structures in such scattergrams that are often seen in experimental records are not quantifiable by serial correlation coefficients. Here, we develop a method to quantify clustered structures in any two-dimensional scattergram of pairs of interspike intervals. The method gives a cluster coefficient as well as clustering density function that could be used to quantify clustering in scattergrams obtained from first- or higher-order interval return maps of single spike trains, or interspike interval pairs drawn from simultaneously recorded spike trains. The method is illustrated using numerical spike trains as well as in vitro pairwise recordings of rat striatal tonically active neurons.},

Hansel et al. (1995) have numerically shown that synchrony is difficult to achieve with these models and that the phase resetting curve is strictly positive. We use singular perturbation methods and averaging to show that this is a general property of Type I membrane models. We show in a limited sense that so called Type II resetting occurs with models that obtain rhythmicity via a Hopf bifurcation. We also show the differences between synapses that act rapidly and those that act slowly and derive a canonical form for the phase interactions.},

Dedicated time series analysis tools allow taking full advantage of these data. Such tools can reveal periodic patterns, help to build predictive models or, on the contrary, quantify irregularities that make community behavior unpredictable. Microbial communities can change abruptly in response to small perturbations, linked to changing conditions or the presence of multiple stable states. With sufficient samples or time points, such alternative states can be detected. In addition, temporal variation of microbial interactions can be captured with time-varying networks. Here, we apply these techniques on multiple longitudinal datasets to illustrate their potential for microbiome research.},

This review shows that this model mechanism can explain the origins of cyclic movements in six different preparations for which the neuronal circuits are available. The overall function of reciprocal inhibition, when combined with a variety of dynamic properties in each of the circuits, is to generate stable antiphasic or multiphasic output patterns. Apparent redundancy in the identified circuits may lend additional robustness to the oscillations, but it also increases the difficulty of identifying critical circuit elements.}

  date = {2013-12-02},
  abstract = {High dimensional data suffer from unwanted variation, such as the batch effects common in microarray data. Unwanted variation complicates the analysis of high dimensional data, leading to high rates of false discoveries, high rates of missed discoveries, or both. In many cases the factors causing the unwanted variation are unknown and must be inferred from the data. In such cases, negative controls may be used to identify the unwanted variation and separate it from the wanted variation. We present a new method, RUV-4, to adjust for unwanted variation in high dimensional data with negative controls. RUV-4 may be used when the goal of the analysis is to determine which of the features are truly associated with a given factor of interest. One nice property of RUV-4 is that it is relatively insensitive to the number of unwanted factors included in the model; this makes estimating the number of factors less critical. We also present a novel method for estimating the features’ variances that may be used even when a large number of unwanted factors are included in the model and the design matrix is full rank. We name this the “inverse method for estimating variances.” By combining RUV-4 with the inverse method, it is no longer necessary to estimate the number of unwanted factors at all. Using both real and simulated data we compare the performance of RUV-4 with that of other adjustment methods such as SVA, LEAPP, ICE, and RUV-2. We find that RUV-4 and its variants perform as well or better than other methods.},

Previous metagenomic analyses of gut microflora revealed associations between specific microbes and host age. Nonetheless there was no reliable way to tell a host's age based on the gut community composition. Here we developed a method of predicting hosts' age based on microflora taxonomic profiles using a cross-study dataset and deep learning. Our best model has an architecture of a deep neural network that achieves the mean absolute error of 5.91 years when tested on external data. We further advance a procedure for inferring the role of particular microbes during human aging and defining them as potential aging biomarkers. The described intestinal clock represents a unique quantitative model of gut microflora aging and provides a starting point for building host aging and gut community succession into a single narrative.},

  abstract = {Gut microbiota are shaped by a combination of ecological and evolutionary forces. While the ecological dynamics have been extensively studied, much less is known about how species of gut bacteria evolve over time. Here, we introduce a model-based framework for quantifying evolutionary dynamics within and across hosts using a panel of metagenomic samples. We use this approach to study evolution in approximately 40 prevalent species in the human gut. Although the patterns of between-host diversity are consistent with quasi-sexual evolution and purifying selection on long timescales, we identify new genealogical signatures that challenge standard population genetic models of these processes. Within hosts, we find that genetic differences that accumulate over 6-month timescales are only rarely attributable to replacement by distantly related strains. Instead, the resident strains more commonly acquire a smaller number of putative evolutionary changes, in which nucleotide variants or gene gains or losses rapidly sweep to high frequency. By comparing these mutations with the typical between-host differences, we find evidence that some sweeps may be seeded by recombination, in addition to new mutations. However, comparisons of adult twins suggest that replacement eventually overwhelms evolution over multi-decade timescales, hinting at fundamental limits to the extent of local adaptation. Together, our results suggest that gut bacteria can evolve on human-relevant timescales, and they highlight the connections between these short-term evolutionary dynamics and longer-term evolution across hosts.},

The template for the hallmarks of aging account originated from landmark papers by Hanahan and Weinberg (2000, 2011) defining first six and later ten hallmarks of cancer. Here we assess the strengths and weaknesses of the hallmarks of aging account. As a checklist of diverse major foci of current aging research, it has provided a useful shared overview for biogerontology during a time of transition in the field. It also seems useful in applied biogerontology, to identify interventions (e.g. drugs) that impact multiple symptomatic features of aging. However, while the hallmarks of cancer provide a paradigmatic account of the causes of cancer with profound explanatory power, the hallmarks of aging do not. A worry is that as a non-paradigm the hallmarks of aging have obscured the urgent need to define a genuine paradigm, one that can provide a useful basis for understanding the mechanistic causes of the diverse aging pathologies. We argue that biogerontology must look and move beyond the hallmarks to understand the process of aging.},

  abstract = {The gut microbiome is a dynamic system that changes with host development, health, behavior, diet, and microbe-microbe interactions. Prior work on gut microbial time series has largely focused on autoregressive models (e.g. Lotka-Volterra). However, we show that most of the variance in microbial time series is non-autoregressive. In addition, we show how community state-clustering is flawed when it comes to characterizing within-host dynamics and that more continuous methods are required. Most organisms exhibited stable, mean-reverting behavior suggestive of fixed carrying capacities and abundant taxa were largely shared across individuals. This mean-reverting behavior allowed us to apply sparse vector autoregression (sVAR)—a multivariate method developed for econometrics—to model the autoregressive component of gut community dynamics. We find a strong phylogenetic signal in the non-autoregressive co-variance from our sVAR model residuals, which suggests niche filtering. We show how changes in diet are also non-autoregressive and that Operational Taxonomic Units strongly correlated with dietary variables have much less of an autoregressive component to their variance, which suggests that diet is a major driver of microbial dynamics. Autoregressive variance appears to be driven by multi-day recovery from frequent facultative anaerobe blooms, which may be driven by fluctuations in luminal redox. Overall, we identify two dynamic regimes within the human gut microbiota: one likely driven by external environmental fluctuations, and the other by internal processes.},

We introduce a model-free normalization procedure where features (i.e. bacterial taxa) in case samples are converted to percentiles of the equivalent features in control samples within a study prior to pooling data across studies. We look at how this percentile-normalization method compares to traditional meta-analysis methods for combining independent p-values and to limma and ComBat, widely used batch-correction models developed for RNA microarray data. Overall, we show that percentile-normalization is a simple, non-parametric approach for correcting batch effects and improving sensitivity in case-control meta-analyses.},

  abstract = {Dynamical systems models are a powerful tool for analyzing interactions, stability, resilience, and other key properties in biomedically important microbial ecosystems, such as the gut microbiome. Challenges to modeling and inference in this setting include the large number of species present, and data sparsity/noise characteristics. Here, we introduce a Bayesian statistical method, the Microbial Dynamical Systems Inference Engine 2 (MDSINE2), which infers compact and interpretable ecosystems-scale dynamical systems models from microbiome time-series data. We model microbial dynamics as stochastic processes driven by inferred interaction modules, or groups of microbes with similar interaction structure and responses to perturbations. Additionally, we model the noise characteristics of sequencing and qPCR measurements to provide uncertainty quantification for all outputs. To evaluate MDSINE2, and provide a benchmarking resource for the community, we generated the most densely sampled microbiome time-series to date, which consists of a cohort of mice that received fecal transplants from a human donor and were then subjected to dietary and antibiotic perturbations. Benchmarking on simulated and real data demonstrate that MDSINE2 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and moreover identifies interaction modules that shed new light on ecosystems-scale interactions in the gut microbiome. We provide MDSINE2 as an open-source Python package at: https://github.com/gerberlab/MDSINE2.},

Causal relations can be seen if interventions are properly applied; however, in many cases they are difficult or even impossible to conduct. It is then necessary to discover causal relations by analyzing statistical properties of purely observational data, which is known as causal discovery or causal structure search. This paper aims to give a introduction to and a brief review of the computational methods for causal discovery that were developed in the past three decades, including constraint-based and score-based methods and those based on functional causal models, supplemented by some illustrations and applications.},

In particular, the advent of high-resolution technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing presents new challenges. We first cover how BE modeling differs between traditional datasets and the new data landscape. We also discuss new approaches for measuring and mitigating BEs, including whether a BE is significant enough to warrant correction. Even with the advent of machine learning and artificial intelligence, the increased complexity of next-generation biotechnological data means increased complexities in BE management. We forecast that BEs will not only remain relevant in the age of big data but will become even more important.},

This review analyzes whether realization of goal intentions is facilitated by forming an implementation intention that spells out the when, where, and how of goal striving in advance (“If situation Y is encountered, then I will initiate goal‐directed behavior X!”). Findings from 94 independent tests showed that implementation intentions had a positive effect of medium‐to‐large magnitude (d = .65) on goal attainment. Implementation intentions were effective in promoting the initiation of goal striving, the shielding of ongoing goal pursuit from unwanted influences, disengagement from failing courses of action, and conservation of capability for future goal striving. There was also strong support for postulated component processes: Implementation intention formation both enhanced the accessibility of specified opportunities and automated respective goal‐directed responses. Several directions for future research are outlined.},

This development has opened the way to apply mathematical models to characterize community structure and dynamics, to predict responses to perturbations and to explore general dynamical properties such as stability, alternative stable states and periodicity. Here, we highlight the role of dynamical systems theory in the exploration of microbial communities, with a special emphasis on the generalized Lotka–Volterra (gLV) equations. In particular, we discuss applications, assumptions and limitations of the gLV model, mention modifications to address these limitations and review stochastic extensions. The development of dynamical models, together with the generation of time series data, can improve the design and control of microbial communities.},

  abstract = {Accurate measurement of the biological markers of the aging process could provide an “aging clock” measuring predicted longevity and allow for the quantification of the effects of specific lifestyle choices on healthy aging. Using modern machine learning techniques, we demonstrate that chronological age can be predicted accurately from (a) the expression level of human genes in capillary blood, and (b) the expression level of microbial genes in stool samples. The latter uses the largest existing metatranscriptomic dataset, stool samples from 90,303 individuals, and is the highest-performing gut microbiome-based aging model reported to date. Our analysis suggests associations between biological age and lifestyle/health factors, e.g., people on a paleo diet or with IBS tend to be biologically older, and people on a vegetarian diet tend to be biologically younger. We delineate the key pathways of systems-level biological decline based on the age-specific features of our model; targeting these mechanisms can aid in development of new anti-aging therapeutic strategies.},

  abstract = {The hallmarks of aging constitute an interconnected network of basic mechanisms that modulate aging and can be modulated by lifestyle factors, including dietary strategies. This narrative review aimed to summarize the evidence on promoting dietary restriction or adherence to specific dietary patterns on hallmarks of aging. Studies with preclinical models or humans were considered. Dietary restriction (DR), usually operationalized as a reduction in caloric intake, is the main strategy applied to study the axis diet-hallmarks of aging. DR has been shown to modulate mainly genomic instability, loss of proteostasis, deregulating nutrient sensing, cellular senescence, and altered intercellular communication. Much less evidence exists on the role of dietary patterns, with most of the studies evaluating the Mediterranean Diet and other similar plant-based diets, and the ketogenic diet. Potential benefits are described in genomic instability, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and altered intercellular communication. Given the predominant place of food in human life, it is imperative to determine the impact of nutritional strategies on the modulation of lifespan and healthspan, considering applicability, long-term adherence, and side effects.},

Here, we leveraged 16,234 gut microbiome profiles, collected over 14 years from 585 wild baboons, to reveal that host genetic effects on the gut microbiome are nearly universal. Controlling for diet, age, and socioecological variation, 97\% of microbiome phenotypes were significantly heritable, including several reported as heritable in humans. Heritability was typically low (mean = 0.068) but was systematically greater in the dry season, with low diet diversity, and in older hosts. We show that longitudinal profiles and large sample sizes are crucial to quantifying microbiome heritability, and indicate scope for selection on microbiome characteristics as a host phenotype.},

This activity could be evoked in as few as three segments (D8–D10) of the lumbar enlargement isolated from the rest of the spinal cord. The existence of intrinsic oscillations in single neurons was revealed in the presence of tetrodotoxin.

The underlying intrinsic oscillation in membrane potential was revealed in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX). NMDA-induced rhythmicity, in the presence or absence of TTX, was abolished or reduced by NMDA receptor antagonists and by three different classes of antagonists for L-type calcium channels. It is suggested that both NMDA receptor channels and L-type calcium channels contribute to NMDA-induced intrinsic oscillations in mature spinal motoneurons.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have highlighted the importance of ecological interactions in dysbiosis of gut microbiota, but few focused on their role in antibiotic-induced perturbations. We used the data from the CEREMI trial in which 22 healthy volunteers received a 3-day course of ceftriaxone or cefotaxime antibiotics. Fecal samples were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene profiling, and the total bacterial counts were determined in each sample by flux cytometry. As the gut exposure to antibiotics could not be experimentally measured despite a marked impact on the gut microbiota, it was reconstructed using the counts of susceptible Escherichia coli. The dynamics of absolute counts of bacterial families were analyzed using a generalized Lotka-Volterra equations and nonlinear mixed effect modeling. Bacterial interactions were studied using a stepwise approach. Two negative and three positive interactions were identified. Introducing bacterial interactions in the modeling approach better fitted the data, and provided different estimates of antibiotic effects on each bacterial family than a simple model without interaction. The time to return to 95\% of the baseline counts was significantly longer in ceftriaxone-treated individuals than in cefotaxime-treated subjects for two bacterial families: Akkermansiaceae (median [range]: 11.3 days [0; 180.0] vs. 4.2 days [0; 25.6], p = 0.027) and Tannerellaceae (13.7 days [6.1; 180.0] vs. 6.2 days [5.4; 17.3], p = 0.003). Taking bacterial interaction as well as individual antibiotic exposure profile into account improves the analysis of antibiotic-induced dysbiosis.},

  abstract = {Providing insight into one’s health status from a gut microbiome sample is an important clinical goal in current human microbiome research. Herein, we introduce the~Gut Microbiome Health Index (GMHI), a biologically-interpretable mathematical formula for predicting the likelihood of disease independent of the clinical~diagnosis. GMHI is formulated upon 50 microbial species associated with healthy gut ecosystems. These species are identified through a multi-study, integrative analysis on 4347 human stool metagenomes from 34 published studies across healthy and 12 different nonhealthy conditions, i.e., disease or abnormal bodyweight. When demonstrated on our population-scale meta-dataset, GMHI is the most robust and consistent predictor of disease presence (or absence) compared to α-diversity indices. Validation on 679 samples from 9 additional studies results in a balanced accuracy of 73.7\% in distinguishing healthy from non-healthy groups. Our findings suggest that gut taxonomic signatures can predict health status, and highlight how data sharing efforts can provide broadly~applicable discoveries.},

Diet is one of the determinants of gut microbiome variation. It is intriguing how fasting can affect gut microbiome. Herein, sixteen individuals were recruited with six individuals subjected to a water-only fast and ten individuals receiving a juice fast, both for seven days. Stool samples were collected daily prior to and post fasting. Water-only fasting dramatically changed the bacterial community that participants developed more homogenous gut microbiomes during the fasting period. Conversely, eight out of ten subjects were not significantly affected by juice fasting with no increased homogeneity between participants. Despite the personalized effect of water-only fasting on microbial taxa, relative abundance of Fusobacterium was reduced in four participants who harbored higher Fusobacterium prior to fasting compared to other two participants. Post fasting Fusobacterium remains consistently low across all six individuals. Microbiome changes due to water-only fasting remained in five subjects even after returning to their normal diet, indicating the resilience of gut microbiome was successfully challenged. These results provided preliminary data on how ceasing food intake can shift gut microbiome. Moreover, water only fasting could be a potential tool to reduce Fusobacterium, which promotes colorectal cancer.},

Further MR analysis observed suggestive causation between Collinsella and parental longevity (father’s age at death) (weighted median: b\,=\,1.79\,×\,­10−\,3, P\,=\,3.52\,×\,­10−\,2). Reverse MR analysis also detected several causal effects of longevity-related traits on gut microbiota, such as longevity and Sporobacter (IVW: b\,=\,7.02\,×\,­10−\,1, P\,=\,4.21\,×\,­10−\,25). Statistical insignificance of the heterogeneity test and pleiotropy test supported the validity of the MR study. Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} Our study found evidence that gut microbiota is causally associated with longevity, or vice versa, providing novel clues for understanding the roles of gut microbiota in aging development.},

It uses invariant manifolds in phase space in order to understand the global structure of the phase space or to construct orbits with desired properties. This paper explains and explores geometric singular perturbation theory and its use in (biological) practice. The three main theorems due to Fenichel are the fundamental tools in the analysis, so the strategy is to state these theorems and explain their significance and applications.

  abstract = {In computational and pure mathematics it is necessary to choose a representation or notation for the object being computed or manipulated. The parallel between notation and computational representation is quite close, although the computer is able to deal with expressions that are far too complicated to be dealt with by hand. A good notation makes manipulations easier and reduces errors, and a good computational representation makes operations easier to implement, thus reducing coding errors. The choice of representation is often not made explicitly, especially when the objects are simple. The choice of representation also serves to distinguish between algorithms. Indeed, once the choice of a representation is made there are often fewer choices of how to proceed. We use this approach in Sect. 3.2 to analyze five algorithms for higher-dimensional continuation that are in the literature. For one-dimensional continuation many issues are quite straightforward, since curves are easily represented as lists of points. However, representing surfaces and manifolds is more challenging. In Sect. 3.1.1 we discuss simplicial and cell complexes, which are general meshes that are commonly used in algebraic topology. Then we define manifolds and manifolds with boundary, which are the analogues of curves and arcs in one dimension. Section 3.1.2 describes two fundamental geometric abstractions, the Voronoi and Delaunay tessellations, and a particular generalization of the Voronoi tessellation that represents the boundary of a union of spherical balls. In Sect. 3.1.3 we discuss how these topological and geometrical ideas have been used to represent manifolds and, finally, how to construct the neighborhood of a regular point.},

This model represents a network of six heart interneurons that comprise the basic rhythm-generating network within a single ganglion. This model builds on a previous two cell model (Nadim et al., 1995) by incorporating modifications of intrinsic and synaptic currents based on the results of a realistic waveform voltage-clamp study (Olsen and Calabrese, 1996). Due to these modifications, the new model behaves more similarly to the biological system than the previous model. For example, the slow-wave oscillation of membrane potential that underlies bursting is similar in form and amplitude to that of the biological system. Furthermore, the new model with its expanded architecture demonstrates how coordinating interneurons contribute to the oscillations within a single ganglion, in addition to their role of intersegmental coordination.},

Conversely, for negative gaps, period 1 and period 2 solutions can coexist. Higher periodic orbits can also exist and be stable and we give several examples of how these solutions behave under parameter variation.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Quetiapine use at standard doses has been associated with hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia. However, whether even frequently prescribed low-dose quetiapine results in significant metabolic disturbances remains unclear. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the association between off-label, low-dose quetiapine and changes in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels/lipid parameters. METHODS: We identified new users of low-dose quetiapine (≤50\,mg tablets) in Denmark 2008-2018 with measurements of HbA1c, total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), or fasting triglycerides (fTG) within 365\,days before and after quetiapine initiation. Mixed-effects linear regression models were used to estimate coefficients (β) with 95\% confidence intervals (95\%CIs) for change in cardiometabolic parameters after quetiapine initiation. Inverse probability weighting was used to mitigate selection bias. Higher doses of quetiapine ({$>$}50\,mg) were included in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Among 106,711 eligible new low-dose quetiapine users (median age~=~45\,years, females~=~55\%), low-dose quetiapine initiation was associated with increased fTG (β~=\,1.049[95\%CI:1.027-1.072]) and decreased HDL-C (β~=\,0.982[0.978-0.986]). Although HbA1c did not change significantly and TC and LDL-C even decreased considering all subjects, all three metabolic parameters increased significantly among individuals with normal pre-quetiapine initiation levels. The adverse metabolic effect of quetiapine on HbA1c, TC, LDL-C, and HDL-C was dose-dependent, which was not the case for fTG. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose quetiapine was associated with a significant increase in fTG and decreases in HDL-C in all subjects, as well as with significant increases in HbA1c, TC, and LDL-C among those with normal baseline values. The risk of metabolic worsening with quetiapine was dose-dependent, except for fTG.},

  abstract = {The advance of Parkinson's disease is associated with the existence of abnormal oscillations within the basal ganglia with frequencies in the beta band (13-30 Hz). While the origin of these oscillations remains unknown, there is some evidence suggesting that oscillations observed in the basal ganglia arise due to interactions of two nuclei: the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the globus pallidus pars externa (GPe). To investigate this hypothesis, we develop a computational model of the STN-GPe network based upon anatomical and electrophysiological studies. Significantly, our study shows that for certain parameter regimes, the model intrinsically oscillates in the beta range. Through an analytical study of the model, we identify a simple set of necessary conditions on model parameters that guarantees the existence of beta oscillations. These conditions for generation of oscillations are described by a set of simple inequalities and can be summarized as follows: (1) The excitatory connections from STN to GPe and the inhibitory connections from GPe to STN need to be sufficiently strong. (2) The time required by neurons to react to their inputs needs to be short relative to synaptic transmission delays. (3) The excitatory input from the cortex to STN needs to be high relative to the inhibition from striatum to GPe. We confirmed the validity of these conditions via numerical simulation. These conditions describe changes in parameters that are consistent with those expected as a result of the development of Parkinson's disease, and predict manipulations that could inhibit the pathological oscillations.},

We observed strong epigenetic aging effects and developed seven highly accurate epigenetic clocks for several tissues (pan-tissue, blood, kidney, liver, skin clocks) and two dual-species (human–NMR) clocks. The skin clock correctly estimated induced pluripotent stem cells derived from NMR fibroblasts to be of prenatal age. The NMR epigenetic clocks revealed that breeding NMR queens age more slowly than nonbreeders, a feature that is also observed in some eusocial insects.

Extension methods are categorized according to the data structures for which they are designed. We consider both univariate and multivariate response longitudinal data and further categorize the repeated measurements according to whether the time effect is relevant. Even though most extensions are proposed for low-dimensional data, some can be applied to high-dimensional data. Information of available software implementations of the reviewed extensions is also given. We conclude with discussions on the limitations of our review and some future research directions.},

We investigate rhythmicactivity in an electrically-coupled population of brainstem neurons driving swimminglocomotion in young frog tadpoles, and how activity is switched on and off by briefsensory stimulation. We build a computational model of 30 electrically-coupledconditional pacemaker neurons on one side of the tadpole hindbrain and spinal cord.Based on experimental estimates for neuron properties, population sizes, synapsestrengths and connections, we show that: long-lasting, mutual, glutamatergic excitationbetween the neurons allows the network to sustain rhythmic pacemaker firing atswimming frequencies following brief synaptic excitation; activity persists but rhythmbreaks down without electrical coupling; NMDA voltage-dependency doubles the rangeof synaptic feedback strengths generating sustained rhythm. The network can beswitched on and off at short latency by brief synaptic excitation and inhibition. Wedemonstrate that a population of generic Hodgkin-Huxley type neurons coupled byglutamatergic excitatory feedback can generate sustained asynchronous firingswitched on and off synaptically. We conclude that networks of neurons with NMDARmediated feedback excitation can generate self-sustained activity following briefsynaptic excitation. The frequency of activity is limited by the kinetics of the neuronmembrane channels and can be stopped by brief inhibitory input. Network activity canbe rhythmic at lower frequencies if the neurons are electrically coupled. Our key findingis that excitatory synaptic feedback can operate to control and sustain stable firing inpopulations of neurons.},

  abstract = {The spinal network underlying locomotion in the lamprey consists of a core network of glutamatergic and glycinergic interneurons, previously studied experimentally and through mathematical modeling. We present a new and more detailed computational model of lamprey locomotor network neurons, based primarily on detailed electrophysiological measurements and incorporating new experimental findings. The model uses a Hodgkin–Huxley-like formalism and consists of 86 membrane compartments containing 12 types of ion currents. One of the goals was to introduce a fast, transient potassium current (Kt) and two sodium-dependent potassium currents, one faster (KNaF) and one slower (KNaS), in the model. Not only has the model lent support to the interpretation of experimental results but it has also provided predictions for further experimental analysis of single-network neurons. For example, Kt was shown to be one critical factor for controlling action potential duration. In addition, the model has proved helpful in investigating the possible influence of the slow afterhyperpolarization on repetitive firing during ongoing activation. In particular, the balance between the simulated slow sodium-dependent and calcium-dependent potassium currents has been explored, as well as the possible involvement of dendritic conductances.},

  abstract = {Rhythmicity is a characteristic of neural networks responsible for locomotion. In many organisms, activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors leads to generation of rhythmic locomotor patterns. In addition, single neurons can display intrinsic, NMDA-dependent membrane potential oscillations when pharmacologically isolated from each other by tetrodotoxin (TTX) application. Such NMDA–TTX oscillations have been characterized, for instance, in lamprey locomotor network neurons. Conceptual and computational models have been put forward to explain the appearance and characteristics of these oscillations. Here, we seek to refine the understanding of NMDA–TTX oscillations by combining new experimental evidence with computational modelling. We find that, in contrast to previous computational predictions, the oscillation frequency tends to increase when the NMDA concentration is increased. We develop a new, minimal computational model which can incorporate this new information. This model is further constrained by another new piece of experimental evidence: that regular-looking NMDA–TTX oscillations can be obtained even after voltage-dependent potassium and high-voltage-activated calcium channels have been pharmacologically blocked. Our model conforms to several experimentally derived criteria that we have set up and is robust to parameter changes, as evaluated through sensitivity analysis. We use the model to re-analyze an old NMDA–TTX oscillation model, and suggest an explanation of why it failed to reproduce the new experimental data that we present here.},

Recent research has uncovered a close association between electrical oscillations and resonance in neurons. Resonance is an easily measurable property that describes the ability of neurons to respond selectively to inputs at preferred frequencies. A variety of ionic mechanisms support resonance and oscillation in neurons. Understanding the basic principles involved in the production of resonance allows for a simplified classification of these mechanisms. The characterization of resonance and frequency preference captures those essential properties of neurons that can serve as a substrate for coordinating network activity around a particular frequency in the brain.},

  abstract = {The abilities of neuronal populations to encode rapidly varying stimuli and respond quickly to abrupt input changes are crucial for basic neuronal computations, such as coincidence detection, grouping by synchrony, and spike-timing-dependent plasticity, as well as for the pro- cessing speed of neuronal networks. Theoretical analyses have linked these abilities to the fast-onset dynamics of action potentials (APs). Using a combination of whole-cell recordings from rat neocortical neurons and computer simulations, we provide the first experimental evidence for this conjecture and prove its validity for the case of distal AP initiation in the axon initial segment (AIS), typical for cortical neurons. Neocortical neurons with fast-onset APs in the soma can phase-lock their population firing to signal frequencies up to ⬚⬚300 – 400 Hz and respond within 1–2 ms to subtle changes of input current. The ability to encode high frequencies and response speed were dramatically reduced when AP onset was slowed by experimental manipulations or was intrinsically slow due to immature AP generation mechanisms. Multicompartment conductance- based models reproducing the initiation of spikes in the AIS could encode high frequencies only if AP onset was fast at the initiation site (e.g., attributable to cooperative gating of a fraction of sodium channels) but not when fast onset of somatic AP was produced solely by backpropa- gation. We conclude that fast-onset dynamics is a genuine property of cortical AP generators. It enables fast computations in cortical circuits that are rich in recurrent connections both within each region and across the hierarchy of areas.},

The θ activity during mental performance seemed to originate in the frontal midline area and tended to appear in the subtests that required continous concentration of attention. 2. 2. As the result of factor analysis of the subtests' scores, four significant factors were extracted: they could be named ability of simple arithmetic and mechanical memory (factor 1), complex arithmetic and rule identification ability (factor 2), ability of discrimination and induction (factor 3), perceptual ability of simple visual patterns (factor 4). 3. 3. Factor analysis of the EEG band scores proved that each σ-, α-, β1- and β2-band component of EEG was of one-factor structure, all the correlation coefficients being approximately +0.9 at each. 4. 4.

  abstract = {The origin of rhythmic activity in brain circuits and CPG-like motor networks is still not fully understood. The main unsolved questions are (i) What are the respective roles of intrinsic bursting and network based dynamics in systems of coupled heterogeneous, intrinsically complex, even chaotic, neurons? (ii) What are the mechanisms underlying the coexistence of robustness and flexibility in the observed rhythmic spatio-temporal patterns? One common view is that particular bursting neurons provide the rhythmogenic component while the connections between different neurons are responsible for the regularisation and synchronisation of groups of neurons and for specific phase relationships in multi-phasic patterns. We have examined the spatio-temporal rhythmic patterns in computer-simulated motif networks of H–H neurons connected by slow inhibitory synapses with a non-symmetric pattern of coupling strengths. We demonstrate that the interplay between intrinsic and network dynamics features either cooperation or competition, depending on three basic control parameters identified in our model: the shape of intrinsic bursts, the strength of the coupling and its degree of asymmetry. The cooperation of intrinsic dynamics and network mechanisms is shown to correlate with bistability, i.e., the coexistence of two different attractors in the phase space of the system corresponding to different rhythmic spatio-temporal patterns. Conversely, if the network mechanism of rhythmogenesis dominates, monostability is observed with a typical pattern of winnerless competition between neurons. We analyse bifurcations between the two regimes and demonstrate how they provide robustness and flexibility to the network performance.},

We show how the type of bifurcation determines the neuro-computational properties of the cells. For example, when the rest state is near a saddle-node bifurcation, the cell can fire all-or-none spikes with an arbitrary low frequency, it has a well-defined threshold manifold, and it acts as an integrator; i.e. the higher the frequency of incoming pulses, the sooner it fires. In contrast, when the rest state is near an Andronov–Hopf bifurcation, the cell fires in a certain frequency range, its spikes are not all-or-none, it does not have a well-defined threshold manifold, it can fire in response to an inhibitory pulse, and it acts as a resonator; i.e. it responds preferentially to a certain (resonant) frequency of the input. Increasing the input frequency may actually delay or terminate its firing. We also describe the phenomenon of neural bursting, and we use geometric bifurcation theory to extend the existing classification of bursters, including many new types. We discuss how the type of burster defines its neuro-computational properties, and we show that different bursters can interact, synchronize and process information differently.},

  abstract = {Periodic bursting behavior in neurons is a recurrent transition between a quiescent state and repetitive spiking. When the transition to repetitive spiking occurs via a subcritical Andronov–Hopf bifurcation and the transition to the quiescent state occurs via fold limit cycle bifurcation, the burster is said to be of elliptic type (also known as a "subHopf/fold cycle" burster). Here we study the synchronization dynamics of weakly connected networks of such bursters. We find that the behavior of such networks is quite different from the behavior of weakly connected phase oscillators and resembles that of strongly connected relaxation oscillators. As a result, such weakly connected bursters need few (usually one) bursts to synchronize, and synchronization is possible for bursters having quite different quantitative features. We also find that interactions between bursters depend crucially on the spiking frequencies. Namely, the interactions are most effective when the presynaptic interspike frequency matches the frequency of postsynaptic oscillations. Finally, we use the FitzHugh–Rinzel, Morris–Lecar, and Hodgkin–Huxley models to illustrate our major results.},

A dominant point of view is that bursts are needed to increase the reliability of communication between neurons. Here, we discuss the alternative, but complementary, hypothesis: bursts with specific resonant interspike frequencies are more likely to cause a postsynaptic cell to fire than are bursts with higher or lower frequencies. Such a frequency preference might occur at the level of individual synapses because of the interplay between short-term synaptic depression and facilitation, or at the postsynaptic cell level because of subthreshold membrane potential oscillations and resonance. As a result, the same burst could resonate for some synapses or cells and not resonate for others, depending on their natural resonance frequencies. This observation suggests that, in addition to increasing reliability of synaptic transmission, bursts of action potentials might provide effective mechanisms for selective communication between neurons.},

  abstract = {This paper applies methods of numerical continuation analysis to document characteristic bifurcation cascades of limit cycles in piecewise-smooth, hybrid-dynamical-system models of the eukaryotic cell cycle, and associated period-adding cascades in piecewise-defined maps with gaps. A general theory is formulated for the occurrence of such cascades, for example given the existence of a period-two orbit with one point on the system discontinuity and with appropriate constraints on the forward trajectory for nearby initial conditions. In this case, it is found that the bifurcation cascade for nearby parameter values exhibits a scaling relationship governed by the largest-in-magnitude Floquet multiplier, here required to be positive and real, in complete agreement with the characteristic scaling observed in the numerical study. A similar cascade is predicted and observed in the case of a saddle–node bifurcation of a period-two orbit, away from the discontinuity, provided that the associated center manifold is found to intersect the discontinuity transversally.},

  abstract = {Recent theoretical work has suggested that brain oscillations in the theta band are involved in active maintenance and recall of working memory representations. To test this theoretical framework we recorded neuromagnetic responses from 10 subjects performing the Sternberg task. Subjects were required to retain a list of 1, 3, 5 or 7 visually presented digits during a 3-s retention period. During the retention period we observed ongoing frontal theta activity in the 7–8.5-Hz band recorded by sensors over frontal brain areas. The activity in the theta band increased parametrically with the number of items retained in working memory. A time–frequency analysis revealed that the task-dependent theta was present during the retention period and during memory scanning. Following the memory task the theta activity was reduced. These results suggest that theta oscillations generated in frontal brain regions play an active role in memory maintenance.},

In this paper, we provide three cases of bifurcation processes related to period-doubling bifurcation cascades to chaos observed in the spontaneous firing patterns recorded from an injured site of rat sciatic nerve as a pacemaker. Period-doubling bifurcation cascades to period-4 (π(2,2)) firstly, and then to chaos, at last to a periodicity, which can be period-5, period-4 (π(4)) and period-3, respectively, in different pacemakers. The three bifurcation processes are labeled as case I, II and III, respectively, manifesting procedures different to those of period-adding bifurcation. Higher-dimensional unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) can be detected in the chaos, built close relationships to the periodic firing patterns. Case III bifurcation process is similar to that discovered in the Onchidium pacemaker neurons and simulated in theoretical model-Chay model. The extra-large Feigenbaum constant manifesting in the period-doubling bifurcation process, induced by quasi-discontinuous characteristics exhibited in the first return maps of both ISI series and slow variable of Chay model, shows that higher-dimensional periodic behaviors appeared difficult within the period-doubling bifurcation cascades. The results not only provide examples of period-doubling bifurcation to chaos and chaos with higher-dimensional UPOs, but also reveal the dynamical features of the period-doubling bifurcation cascades to chaos.},

  abstract = {Non-biological experimental variation or “batch effects" are commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray experiments, often rendering the task of combining data from these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes (\&gt;25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice.

  abstract = {Dynamic changes in microbial communities play an important role in human health and disease. Specifically, deciphering how microbial species in a community interact with each other and their environment can elucidate mechanisms of disease, a problem typically investigated using tools from community ecology. Yet, such methods require measurements of absolute densities, whereas typical datasets only provide estimates of relative abundances. Here, we systematically investigate models of microbial dynamics in the simplex of relative abundances. We derive a new nonlinear dynamical system for microbial dynamics, termed “compositional” Lotka-Volterra (cLV), unifying approaches using generalized Lotka-Volterra (gLV) equations from community ecology and compositional data analysis. On three real datasets, we demonstrate that cLV recapitulates interactions between relative abundances implied by gLV. Moreover, we show that cLV is as accurate as gLV in forecasting microbial trajectories in terms of relative abundances. We further compare cLV to two other models of relative abundance dynamics motivated by common assumptions in the literature—a linear model in a log-ratio transformed space, and a linear model in the space of relative abundances—and provide evidence that cLV more accurately describes community trajectories over time. Finally, we investigate when information about direct effects can be recovered from relative data that naively provide information about only indirect effects. Our results suggest that strong effects may be recoverable from relative data, but more subtle effects are challenging to identify.},

The procedure of period adding bifurcation scenario from period k to period k + 1 bursting ( k = 1, 2, 3, 4) involved in the period-adding cascades and the stochastic effect of noise near each bifurcation point is also reproduced in the discontinuous map. Moreover, dynamics of the border-collision bifurcation are identified in the discontinuous map, which is employed to understand the experimentally observed period increment sequence. The simple discontinuous map is of practical importance in the modeling of collective behaviours of neural populations like synchronization in large neural circuits.},

Oscillation is defined as a spike train in which significant periodicity is detected in its autocorrelogram. The main feature of our burst detection method is that discharge density (i.e., the number of spikes in a short interval) is used instead of the interspike interval. This enables one to assess the likelihood of having burst periods in a spike train. We use the Lomb periodogram to detect periodicity in an autocorrelogram. This method gives one significance of periodicity detected and enables the detection of multiple frequencies in an autocorrelogram. The advantage of these methods is discussed in comparison with the other methods used to detect bursting and oscillatory activity.},

  abstract = {Background Recent evidence suggests a role for the microbiome in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) aetiology and progression. Objective To explore the faecal and salivary microbiota as potential diagnostic biomarkers. Methods We applied shotgun metagenomic and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to samples from a Spanish case–control study (n=136), including 57 cases, 50 controls, and 29 patients with chronic pancreatitis in the discovery phase, and from a German case–control study (n=76), in the validation phase. Results Faecal metagenomic classifiers performed much better than saliva-based classifiers and identified patients with PDAC with an accuracy of up to 0.84 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) based on a set of 27 microbial species, with consistent accuracy across early and late disease stages. Performance further improved to up to 0.94 AUROC when we combined our microbiome-based predictions with serum levels of carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19–9, the only current non-invasive, Food and Drug Administration approved, low specificity PDAC diagnostic biomarker. Furthermore, a microbiota-based classification model confined to PDAC-enriched species was highly disease-specific when validated against 25 publicly available metagenomic study populations for various health conditions (n=5792). Both microbiome-based models had a high prediction accuracy on a German validation population (n=76). Several faecal PDAC marker species were detectable in pancreatic tumour and non-tumour tissue using 16S rRNA sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridisation. Conclusion Taken together, our results indicate that non-invasive, robust and specific faecal microbiota-based screening for the early detection of PDAC is feasible.},

  abstract = {Human gut microbiome is increasingly recognized as a crucial factor in human health and disease. While most studies have focused on cross-sectional data, there is growing interest in longitudinal studies that capture the dynamics of the microbiome over time. Investigating the temporal dynamics of the microbiome, including individual bacterial species and clusters, is essential for comprehending its functionality and impact on health. This knowledge has implications for targeted therapeutic strategies, such as personalized diets and probiotic therapy. Here, by adopting a rigorous statistical approach, we aim to shed light on the temporal changes in the gut microbiome and unravel its intricate behavior over time. We leveraged four long and dense time series of the gut microbiome in generally healthy individuals examining how its composition evolves as a community and how individual bacterial species behave over time. We also explore whether specific clusters of bacteria exhibit similar fluctuations, which could provide insights into potential functional relationships and interactions within the human gut microbiome. Our study reveals that despite its high volatility human gut microbiome is stable in time and can be predicted based solely on its previous states. Employing a statistical approach, we characterize the unique temporal behavior of individual bacterial species. Furthermore, we identify distinct longitudinal regimes in which bacteria exhibit specific patterns of behavior. Additionally, through cluster analysis, we identify groups of bacteria that exhibit coordinated fluctuations over time. These findings contribute to our understanding of the dynamic nature of the gut microbiome and its potential implications for human health.},

  abstract = {Motivation: An important feature of microbiome count data is the presence of a large number of zeros. A common strategy to handle these excess zeros is to add a small number called pseudo-count (e.g., 1). Other strategies include using various probability models to model the excess zero counts. Although adding a pseudo-count is simple and widely used, as demonstrated in this paper, it is not ideal. On the other hand, methods that model excess zeros using a probability model often make an implicit assumption that all zeros can be explained by a common probability models. As described in this article, this is not always recommended as there are potentially three types/sources of zeros in a microbiome data. The purpose of this paper is to develop a simple methodology to identify and accomodate three different types of zeros and to test hypotheses regarding the relative abundance of taxa in two or more experimental groups. Another major contribution of this paper is to perform constrained (directional or ordered) inference when there are more than two ordered experimental groups (e.g., subjects ordered by diet or age groups or environmental exposure groups). As far as we know this is the first paper that addresses such problems in the analysis of microbiome data.Results: Using extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate that the proposed methodology not only controls the false discovery rate at a desired level of significance while competing well in terms of power with DESeq2, a popular procedure derived from RNASeq literature. As expected, the method using pseudo-counts tends to be very conservative and the classical t-test that ignores the underlying simplex structure in the data has an inflated FDR.},

Neuroimaging studies have revealed the contributions of different brain regions to different functional roles in WM tasks; however, little is known about the neural mechanism governing their coordination. Electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms, especially theta and alpha, are known to appear over distributed brain regions during WM tasks, but the rhythms associated with task-relevant regional coupling have not been obtained thus far. In this study, we conducted time–frequency analyses for EEG data in WM tasks that include manipulation periods and memory storage buffer periods. We used both auditory WM tasks and visual WM tasks. The results successfully demonstrated function-specific EEG activities. The frontal theta amplitudes increased during the manipulation periods of both tasks. The alpha amplitudes increased during not only the manipulation but also the maintenance periods in the temporal area for the auditory WM and the parietal area for the visual WM. The phase synchronization analyses indicated that, under the relevant task conditions, the temporal and parietal regions show enhanced phase synchronization in the theta bands with the frontal region, whereas phase synchronization between theta and alpha is significantly enhanced only within the individual areas. Our results suggest that WM task-relevant brain regions are coordinated by distant theta synchronization for central executive functions, by local alpha synchronization for the memory storage buffer, and by theta–alpha coupling for inter-functional integration.},

  abstract = {In traditional physicochemical modeling, one derives evolution equations at the (macroscopic, coarse) scale of interest; these are used to perform a variety of tasks (simulation, bifurcation analysis, optimization) using an arsenal of analytical and numerical techniques. For many complex systems, however, although one observes evolution at a macroscopic scale of interest, accurate models are only given at a more detailed (fine-scale, microscopic) level of description (e.g., lattice Boltzmann, kinetic Monte Carlo, molecular dynamics). Here, we review a framework for computer-aided multiscale analysis, which enables macroscopic computational tasks (over extended spatiotemporal scales) using only appropriately initialized microscopic simulation on short time and length scales. The methodology bypasses the derivation of macroscopic evolution equations when these equations conceptually exist but are not available in closed form-hence the term equation-free. We selectively discuss basic algorithms and underlying principles and illustrate the approach through representative applications. We also discuss potential difficulties and outline areas for future research.},

  abstract = {The molecular and cellular bases of cell shape change and movement during morphogenesis and wound healing are of intense interest and are only beginning to be understood. Here, we investigate the forces responsible for morphogenesis during dorsal closure with three approaches. First, we use real-time and time-lapsed laser confocal microscopy to follow actin dynamics and document cell shape changes and tissue movements in living, unperturbed embryos. We label cells with a ubiquitously expressed transgene that encodes GFP fused to an autonomously folding actin binding fragment from fly moesin. Second, we use a biomechanical approach to examine the distribution of stiffness/tension during dorsal closure by following the response of the various tissues to cutting by an ultraviolet laser. We tested our previous model (Young, P.E., A.M. Richman, A.S. Ketchum, and D.P. Kiehart. 1993. Genes Dev. 7:29–41) that the leading edge of the lateral epidermis is a contractile purse-string that provides force for dorsal closure. We show that this structure is under tension and behaves as a supracellular purse-string, however, we provide evidence that it alone cannot account for the forces responsible for dorsal closure. In addition, we show that there is isotropic stiffness/tension in the amnioserosa and anisotropic stiffness/tension in the lateral epidermis. Tension in the amnioserosa may contribute force for dorsal closure, but tension in the lateral epidermis opposes it. Third, we examine the role of various tissues in dorsal closure by repeated ablation of cells in the amnioserosa and the leading edge of the lateral epidermis. Our data provide strong evidence that both tissues appear to contribute to normal dorsal closure in living embryos, but surprisingly, neither is absolutely required for dorsal closure. Finally, we establish that the Drosophila epidermis rapidly and reproducibly heals from both mechanical and ultraviolet laser wounds, even those delivered repeatedly. During healing, actin is rapidly recruited to the margins of the wound and a newly formed, supracellular purse-string contracts during wound healing. This result establishes the Drosophila embryo as an excellent system for the investigation of wound healing. Moreover, our observations demonstrate that wound healing in this insect epidermal system parallel wound healing in vertebrate tissues in situ and vertebrate cells in culture (for review see Kiehart, D.P. 1999. Curr. Biol. 9:R602–R605).},

Physiologically suggestive forms are used for both types of negative feedback. We also consider the effects of employing two different types of firing rate function, a Heaviside step function and a piecewise linear function. We first derive conditions for the existence of traveling fronts and pulses in the case of a Heaviside step firing rate, and show that adaptation plays a relatively minor role in determining the characteristics of traveling waves. We then derive conditions for the existence and stability of stationary pulses or bumps, and show that a purely excitatory network with synaptic depression cannot support stable bumps. However, bumps do not exist in the presence of adaptation. Finally, in the case of a piecewise linear firing rate function, we show numerically that the network also supports self-sustained oscillations between an Up state and a Down state, in which a spatially localized oscillating core periodically emits pulses at each cycle.},

  abstract = {We are interested in noise-induced firings of subthreshold neurons which may be used for encoding environmental stimuli. Noise-induced population synchronization was previously studied only for the case of global coupling, unlike the case of subthreshold spiking neurons. Hence, we investigate the effect of complex network architecture on noise-induced synchronization in an inhibitory population of subthreshold bursting Hindmarsh–Rose neurons. For modeling complex synaptic connectivity, we consider the Watts–Strogatz small-world network which interpolates between regular lattice and random network via rewiring, and investigate the effect of small-world connectivity on emergence of noise-induced population synchronization. Thus, noise-induced burst synchronization (synchrony on the slow bursting time scale) and spike synchronization (synchrony on the fast spike time scale) are found to appear in a synchronized region of the JJJ–DDD plane (JJJ: synaptic inhibition strength and DDD: noise intensity). As the rewiring probability ppp is decreased from 1 (random network) to 0 (regular lattice), the region of spike synchronization shrinks rapidly in the JJJ–DDD plane, while the region of the burst synchronization decreases slowly. We separate the slow bursting and the fast spiking time scales via frequency filtering, and characterize the noise-induced burst and spike synchronizations by employing realistic order parameters and statistical-mechanical measures introduced in our recent work. Thus, the bursting and spiking thresholds for the burst and spike synchronization transitions are determined in terms of the bursting and spiking order parameters, respectively. Furthermore, we also measure the degrees of burst and spike synchronizations in terms of the statistical-mechanical bursting and spiking measures, respectively.},

  abstract = {We are interested in characterization of synchronization transitions of bursting neurons in the frequency domain. Instantaneous population firing rate (IPFR) R(t)R(t)R(t), which is directly obtained from the raster plot of neural spikes, is often used as a realistic collective quantity describing population activities in both the computational and the experimental neuroscience. For the case of spiking neurons, a realistic time-domain order parameter, based on R(t)R(t)R(t), was introduced in our recent work to characterize the spike synchronization transition. Unlike the case of spiking neurons, the IPFR R(t)R(t)R(t) of bursting neurons exhibits population behaviors with both the slow bursting and the fast spiking timescales. For our aim, we decompose the IPFR R(t)R(t)R(t) into the instantaneous population bursting rate Rb(t)Rb(t)R\_b(t) (describing the bursting behavior) and the instantaneous population spike rate Rs(t)Rs(t)R\_s(t) (describing the spiking behavior) via frequency filtering, and extend the realistic order parameter to the case of bursting neurons. Thus, we develop the frequency-domain bursting and spiking order parameters which are just the bursting and spiking “coherence factors” βbβb\textbackslash beta \_b and βsβs\textbackslash beta \_s of the bursting and spiking peaks in the power spectral densities of RbRbR\_b and RsRsR\_s (i.e., “signal to noise” ratio of the spectral peak height and its relative width). Through calculation of βbβb\textbackslash beta \_b and βsβs\textbackslash beta \_s, we obtain the bursting and spiking thresholds beyond which the burst and spike synchronizations break up, respectively. Consequently, it is shown in explicit examples that the frequency-domain bursting and spiking order parameters may be usefully used for characterization of the bursting and the spiking transitions, respectively.},

The intestinal tract is the largest surface in the human body that directly interacts with foreign antigens – it is covered with extremely complex and diverse community of microorganisms, known as the gut microbiome. In a healthy gut, microbial communities maintain a homeostatic metabolism and reside within the host in a state of immune tolerance. Abnormal shifts in the gut microbiome, however, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of age-related chronic diseases, including obesity, cardiovascular diseases and neurodegenerative diseases. The gut microbiome is emerging as a key factor in the aging process. In this review, we describe studies of humans and model organisms that suggest a direct causal role of the gut microbiome on host aging. Additionally, we discuss sex-dimorphism in the gut microbiome and its possible roles in age-related sex-dimorphic phenotypes. We also provide an overview of widely used microbiome analysis methods and tools which could be used to explore the impact of microbiome remodeling on aging.},

Processes of memory consolidation typically occurring during this state of sleep were also enhanced. Here, we show that the same tSOS applied in the waking brain also induced an increase in endogenous EEG slow oscillations (0.4–1.2 Hz), although in a topographically restricted fashion. Applied during wakefulness tSOS, additionally, resulted in a marked and widespread increase in EEG theta (4–8 Hz) activity. During wake, tSOS did not enhance consolidation of memories when applied after learning, but improved encoding of hippocampus-dependent memories when applied during learning. We conclude that the EEG frequency and related memory processes induced by tSOS critically depend on brain state. In response to tSOS during wakefulness the brain transposes stimulation by responding preferentially with theta oscillations and facilitated encoding.},

Here we pursue the question of whether this picture can be justified and study the four-dimensional neuron model of Hodgkin and Huxley as a concrete example. The model is approximated by a response kernel expansion in terms of a single variable, the membrane voltage. The first-order term is linear in the input and its kernel has the typical form of an elementary postsynaptic potential. Higher-order kernels take care of nonlinear interactions between input spikes. In contrast to the standard Volterra expansion, the kernels depend on the firing time of the most recent output spike. In particular, a zero-order kernel that describes the shape of the spike and the typical after-potential is included. Our model neuron fires if the membrane voltage, given by the truncated response kernel expansion, crosses a threshold. The threshold model is tested on a spike train generated by the Hodgkin-Huxley model with a stochastic input current. We find that the threshold model predicts 90 percent of the spikes correctly. Our results show that, to good approximation, the description of a neuron as a threshold element can indeed be justified.},

  abstract = {The lack of exact definition of the concept of biological age (BA) is a typical feature of works concerning BA. That is why comparison of results of various published methods makes little sense and eventual proof of their optimality is impossible. Based on natural and simple presumptions, an attempt to express mathematically the supposed relation between chronological age (CA) and BA has proven to be unexpectedly fruitful. In the present paper, an optimum method of estimation of BA, which is easily applicable even in nonlinear cases, is derived. Moreover, the method allows evaluating the precision of the estimates and also offers tools for validation of presumptions of the method. A special feature of the method is that CA should be used as a standard biomarker, leading to essential improving the precision of BA-estimate and illuminating relativity of the known “paradox of biomarkers”. All theoretical results of the method were fully approved by means of a special simulation program. Further, the theory and the results of the simulation have proven that many published results of BA-estimates using multiple linear regression (MLR) are very probably disserviceable because CA is typically more precise estimate of BA than estimates computed by MLR. This unpleasant conclusion also concerns methods, which use MLR as the final step after transformation of the battery of biomarkers by factor analysis or by principal component analysis.},

They normally fire constantly at a low rate, and speed up, firing a phasic burst when reward exceeds prediction, or pause when an expected reward does not occur. Therefore, the detection of bursts and pauses from spike train data is a critical problem when studying the role of phasic dopamine (DA) in reward related learning, and other DA dependent behaviors. However, few statistical methods have been developed that can identify bursts and pauses simultaneously. We propose a new statistical method, the Robust Gaussian Surprise (RGS) method, which performs an exhaustive search of bursts and pauses in spike trains simultaneously. We found that the RGS method is adaptable to various patterns of spike trains recorded in vivo, and is not influenced by baseline firing rate, making it applicable to all in vivo spike trains where baseline firing rates vary over time. We compare the performance of the RGS method to other methods of detecting bursts, such as the Poisson Surprise (PS), Rank Surprise (RS), and Template methods. Analysis of data using the RGS method reveals potential mechanisms underlying how bursts and pauses are controlled in DA neurons.},

Earlier small-scale models predicted that a population of excitatory neurons would be sufficient to produce burst activity, and this has recently been experimentally confirmed. Here we simulate the hemicord activity induced under various experimental conditions, including pharmacological activation by NMDA and AMPA as well as electrical stimulation. The model network comprises a realistic number of cells and synaptic connectivity patterns. Using similar distributions of cellular and synaptic parameters, as have been estimated experimentally, a large variation in dynamic characteristics like firing rates, burst, and cycle durations were seen in single cells. On the network level an overall rhythm was generated because the synaptic interactions cause partial synchronization within the population. This network rhythm not only emerged despite the distributed cellular parameters but relied on this variability, in particular, in reproducing variations of the activity during the cycle and showing recruitment in interneuronal populations. A slow rhythm (0.4–2 Hz) can be induced by tonic activation of NMDA-sensitive channels, which are voltage dependent and generate depolarizing plateaus. The rhythm emerges through a synchronization of bursts of the individual neurons. A fast rhythm (4–12 Hz), induced by AMPA, relies on spike synchronization within the population, and each burst is composed of single spikes produced by different neurons. The dynamic range of the fast rhythm is limited by the ability of the network to synchronize oscillations and depends on the strength of synaptic connections and the duration of the slow after hyperpolarization. The model network also produces prolonged bouts of rhythmic activity in response to brief electrical activations, as seen experimentally. The mutual excitation can sustain long-lasting activity for a realistic set of synaptic parameters. The bout duration depends on the strength of excitatory synaptic connections, the level of persistent depolarization, and the influx of Ca2+ ions and activation of Ca2+-dependent K+ current.},

Such modules are flexibly controlled and operate with a considerable degree of autonomy. One example is locomotion generated by spinal central pattern generator networks (CPGs) that shape the detailed motor output. The level of activity is controlled from brainstem locomotor command centers, which in turn, are under the control of the basal ganglia. By using a biophysically detailed, full-scale computational model of the lamprey CPG (10,000 neurons) and its brainstem/forebrain control, we demonstrate general control principles that can adapt the network to different demands. Forward or backward locomotion and steering can be flexibly controlled by local synaptic effects limited to only the very rostral part of the network. Variability in response properties within each neuronal population is an essential feature and assures a constant phase delay along the cord for different locomotor speeds.},

  abstract = {Nonlinear principal component analysis is a novel technique for multivariate data analysis, similar to the well-known method of principal component analysis. NLPCA, like PCA, is used to identify and remove correlations among problem variables as an aid to dimensionality reduction, visualization, and exploratory data analysis. While PCA identifies only linear correlations between variables, NLPCA uncovers both linear and nonlinear correlations, without restriction on the character of the nonlinearities present in the data. NLPCA operates by training a feedforward neural network to perform the identity mapping, where the network inputs are reproduced at the output layer. The network contains an internal “bottleneck” layer (containing fewer nodes than input or output layers), which forces the network to develop a compact representation of the input data, and two additional hidden layers. The NLPCA method is demonstrated using time-dependent, simulated batch reaction data. Results show that NLPCA successfully reduces dimensionality and produces a feature space map resembling the actual distribution of the underlying system parameters.},

Methods: ERD/ERS responses of the 4–6, 6–8, 8–10 and 10–12 Hz EEG frequency bands were studied in 24 normal subjects performing a visual sequential letter task (so-called n-back task) in which memory load was varied from 0 to 2. Results: In the 4–6 Hz theta frequency band, a long-lasting synchronization was observed in the anterior electrodes, especially after the presentation of targets. In the 6–8 and 8–10 Hz frequency bands, anterior ERS was elicited especially in the 2-back condition (highest memory load). In contrast to the responses of the 8–10 Hz frequency band, in the 10–12 Hz frequency band the 2-back experimental condition elicited the greatest ERD. Conclusions: In the highest memory load (2-back) experimental condition the attentional capacities were most probably exceeded, resulting in 6–8 and 8–10 Hz ERS. This might reflect an inhibition of such brain areas (frontal cortices) no longer involved in task completion when alternative strategies are needed and utilized. These more `cognitive' strategies were then reflected as an increase in 10–12 Hz ERD. Additionally, our results support the assumption that the simultaneously recorded ERD/ERS responses of different narrow EEG frequency bands differ and reflect distinct aspects of information processing.},

In recent years, many different methods have been proposed that typically compare the timing of spikes on a certain time scale to be optimized by the analyst. Here, we propose the ISI-distance, a simple complementary approach that extracts information from the interspike intervals by evaluating the ratio of the instantaneous firing rates. The method is parameter free, time scale independent and easy to visualize as illustrated by an application to real neuronal spike trains obtained in vitro from rat slices. In a comparison with existing approaches on spike trains extracted from a simulated Hindemarsh–Rose network, the ISI-distance performs as well as the best time-scale-optimized measure based on spike timing.},

  abstract = {Intracellular Ca2+ can reversibly reduce the activity of native N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in hippocampal neurons, a phenomenon termed Ca2+-dependent inactivation. We examined inactivation in heteromeric NMDA receptors expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells using whole-cell recording. NR1-1a/2A heteromers showed reversible inactivation that was very similar to native NMDA receptors in cultured hippocampal neurons. Inactivation was dependent on the extracellular Ca2+ concentration and the degree of intracellular Ca2+ buffering. In 2 mM extracellular Ca2+, inactivation resulted in a 46.1 +/- 12.6\% reduction in the whole-cell current during a 5-sec agonist application. Inactivation of NR1-1a/2A heteromers was unaffected by calcineurin inhibitors, staurosporine, or phalloidin. NR1-1a/2D heteromers also showed a similar degree of inactivation. In contrast, NR1-1a/2B and NR1-1a/2C heteromers showed no significant inactivation. At saturating concentrations of NMDA (1 mM), NR1-1a/2A heteromers also showed Ca- and glycine-independent desensitization, as seen in native hippocampal neurons. Ca(2+)- and glycine-independent desensitization was less pronounced in NR1-1a/2B heteromers and absent in NR1-1a/2C heteromers. Activation of NR1-1a/2C heteromers triggered intracellular Ca2+ transients similar to NR1-1a/2A heteromers as verified by combined Ca2+ imaging and whole-cell recording. Thus differences in Ca2+ permeability were not responsible for the lack of inactivation in NR1-1a/2C heteromers. Our results show that inactivation of recombinant NMDA receptors requires either the NR2A or NR2D subunit, whereas both inactivation and desensitization were absent in NR2C-containing receptors. The gating of inactivating NMDA receptors is more likely to be influenced by ongoing NMDA receptor activity and Ca2+ transients, perhaps consistent with the prominent expression of NR2A in hippocampus and cerebral cortex.},

A depolarization-activated inward current (DIC) has been hypothesized to contribute to this bursting activity. To explore the mechanism for STN burst firing in this setting, we augmented a previously published conductance-based computational model for single rat STN neurons to include both DIC and NMDA currents, fit to data from published electrophysiological recordings. Simulations show that with these additions, the model engages in bursting activity at {$<$}1 Hz in response to hyperpolarizing current injection and that this bursting exhibits several features observed experimentally in STN. Furthermore, a reduced model is used to show that the combination of NMDA and DIC currents, but not either alone, suffices to generate oscillations under hyperpolarizing current injection. STN neurons show enhanced burstiness in Parkinson's disease patients and experimental models of parkinsonism, and the burst mechanism studied presently could contribute to this effect.},

Non-linear constrained and unconstrained optimization problems are formulated to estimate model parameters as well as synaptic inputs using ISIs data. The primal-dual interior-point method is implemented to solve the constrained optimization problem. Reasonable model parameters are estimated by solving these optimization problems which may serve as a template for studying and developing a model of ensemble cortical neurons for neuroprosthesis applications.},

For the study of non-equilibrium cooperative systems, some theoretical guid ing principle would be highly desirable. In this connection, this book pushes for ward a particular physical viewpoint based on the slaving principle. The dis covery of tbis principle in non-equilibrium phase transitions, especially in lasers, was due to Hermann Haken. The great utility of this concept will again be dem onstrated in tbis book for the fields of coupled nonlinear oscillators.},

The idea was to write a simple text that could serve as a seri ous introduction to the subject. Of course, the meaning of "simplicity" varies from person to person and from country to country. The word "introduction" contains even more ambiguity. To start reading this book, only a moder ate knowledge of linear algebra and calculus is required. Other preliminaries, qualified as "elementary" in modern mathematics, are explicitly formulated in the book. These include the Fredholm Alternative for linear systems and the multidimensional Implicit Function Theorem. Using these very limited tools, a framewo:k of notions, results, and methods is gradually built that allows one to read (and possibly write) scientific papers on bifurcations of nonlinear dynamical systems. Among other things, progress in the sciences means that mathematical results and methods that once were new become standard and routinely used by the research and development community. Hopefully, this edition of the book will contribute to this process. The book's structure has been kept intact. Most of the changes introduced reflect recent theoretical and software developments in which the author was involved. Important changes in the third edition can be summarized as follows. A new section devoted to the fold-flip bifurcation for maps has appeared in Chapter 9.},

The majority (82) of participants provided sufficient data for analysis, and increases in automaticity (calculated with a sub‐set of SRHI items) were examined over the study period. Nonlinear regressions fitted an asymptotic curve to each individual's automaticity scores over the 84 days. The model fitted for 62 individuals, of whom 39 showed a good fit. Performing the behaviour more consistently was associated with better model fit. The time it took participants to reach 95\% of their asymptote of automaticity ranged from 18 to 254 days; indicating considerable variation in how long it takes people to reach their limit of automaticity and highlighting that it can take a very long time. Missing one opportunity to perform the behaviour did not materially affect the habit formation process. With repetition of a behaviour in a consistent context, automaticity increases following an asymptotic curve which can be modelled at the individual level.},

Gene co-expression networks have been used to describe the relationships between gene transcripts. Ample literature exists on how to detect biologically meaningful modules in networks but there is a need for methods that allow one to study the relationships between modules. We show that network methods can also be used to describe the relationships between co-expression modules and present the following methodology. First, we describe several methods for detecting modules that are shared by two or more networks (referred to as consensus modules). We represent the gene expression profiles of each module by an eigengene. Second, we propose a method for constructing an eigengene network, where the edges are undirected but maintain information on the sign of the co-expression information. Third, we propose methods for differential eigengene network analysis that allow one to assess the preservation of network properties across different data sets. We illustrate the value of eigengene networks in studying the relationships between consensus modules in human and chimpanzee brains; the relationships between consensus modules in brain, muscle, liver, and adipose mouse tissues; and the relationships between male-female mouse consensus modules and clinical traits. In some applications, we find that module eigengenes can be organized into higher level clusters which we refer to as meta-modules. Eigengene networks can be effective and biologically meaningful tools for studying the relationships between modules of a gene co-expression network. The proposed methods may reveal a higher order organization of the transcriptome.

  abstract = {The accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) in the adult rat is organized into external (ECL) and internal (ICL) cellular layers separated by the lateral olfactory tract (LOT). The most superficial layer, or vomeronasal nerve layer, is composed of two fiber contingents that distribute in rostral and caudal halves. The second layer, or glomerular layer, is also divided by a conspicuous invagination of the neuropil of the ECL at the junction of the rostral and caudal halves. The ECL contains eight cell types distributed in three areas: a subglomerular area containing juxtaglomerular and superficial short-axon neurons, an intermediate area harboring large principal cells (LPC), or mitral and tufted cells, and a deep area containing dwarf, external granule, polygonal, and round projecting cells. The ICL contains two neuron types: internal granule (IGC) and main accessory cells (MACs). The dendrites and axons of LPCs in the two AOB halves are organized symmetrically with respect to an anatomical plane called linea alba. The LPC axon collaterals may recruit adjacent intrinsic, possibly gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic, neurons that, in turn, interact with the dendrites of the adjacent LPCs. These modules may underlie the process of decoding pheromonal clues. The most rostral ICL contains another neuron group termed interstitial neurons of the bulbi (INBs) that includes both intrinsic and projecting neurons. MACs and INBs share inputs from fiber efferents arising in the main olfactory bulb (MOB) and AOB and send axons to IGCs. Because IGCs are a well-known source of modulatory inputs to LPCs, both MACs and INBs represent a site of convergence of the MOB with the AOB.},

  abstract = {With the advent of single cell/nucleus RNA sequencing (sc/snRNA-seq), the field of cell phenotyping is now a data-driven exercise providing statistical evidence to support cell type/state categorization. However, the task of classifying cells into specific, well-defined categories with the empirical data provided by sc/snRNA-seq remains nontrivial due to the difficulty in determining specific differences between related cell types with close transcriptional similarities, resulting in challenges with matching cell types identified in separate experiments. To investigate possible approaches to overcome these obstacles, we explored the use of supervised machine learning methods—logistic regression, support vector machines, random forests, neural networks, and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM)–as approaches to classify cell types using snRNA-seq datasets from human brain middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and human kidney. Classification accuracy was evaluated using an F-beta score weighted in favor of precision to account for technical artifacts of gene expression dropout. We examined the impact of hyperparameter optimization and feature selection methods on F-beta score performance. We found that the best performing model for granular cell type classification in both datasets is a multinomial logistic regression classifier and that an effective feature selection step was the most influential factor in optimizing the performance of the machine learning pipelines.},

  abstract = {Evidence suggests that caffeine (CF) reduces cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. However, the mechanism by which this occurs has not yet been uncovered. Here, we investigated the effect of CF on the expression of two bona fide regulators of circulating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) levels; the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). Following the observation that CF reduced circulating PCSK9 levels and increased hepatic LDLR expression, additional CF-derived analogs with increased potency for PCSK9 inhibition compared to CF itself were developed. The PCSK9-lowering effect of CF was subsequently confirmed in a cohort of healthy volunteers. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that CF increases hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ levels to block transcriptional~activation of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2)~responsible for the regulation of PCSK9, thereby increasing the expression of the LDLR and clearance of LDLc. Our findings highlight ER Ca2+ as a master regulator of cholesterol metabolism and identify a mechanism by which CF may protect against CVD.},

In addition to the measured variable(s) of interest, there will tend to be sources of signal due to factors that are unknown, unmeasured, or too complicated to capture through simple models. We show that failing to incorporate these sources of heterogeneity into an analysis can have widespread and detrimental effects on the study. Not only can this reduce power or induce unwanted dependence across genes, but it can also introduce sources of spurious signal to many genes. This phenomenon is true even for well-designed, randomized studies. We introduce “surrogate variable analysis” (SVA) to overcome the problems caused by heterogeneity in expression studies. SVA can be applied in conjunction with standard analysis techniques to accurately capture the relationship between expression and any modeled variables of interest. We apply SVA to disease class, time course, and genetics of gene expression studies. We show that SVA increases the biological accuracy and reproducibility of analyses in genome-wide expression studies.},

These sources of noise must be modeled and removed to accurately measure biological variability and to obtain correct statistical inference when performing high-throughput genomic analysis. We introduced surrogate variable analysis (sva) for estimating these artifacts by (i) identifying the part of the genomic data only affected by artifacts and (ii) estimating the artifacts with principal components or singular vectors of the subset of the data matrix. The resulting estimates of artifacts can be used in subsequent analyses as adjustment factors to correct analyses. Here I describe a version of the sva approach specifically created for count data or FPKMs from sequencing experiments based on appropriate data transformation. I also describe the addition of supervised sva (ssva) for using control probes to identify the part of the genomic data only affected by artifacts. I present a comparison between these versions of sva and other methods for batch effect estimation on simulated data, real count-based data and FPKM-based data. These updates are available through the sva Bioconductor package and I have made fully reproducible analysis using these methods available from: https://github.com/jtleek/svaseq.},

  abstract = {Simultaneous recordings were made from small collections (2-7) of spontaneously active single units in the striate cortex of unanesthetized cats, by means of chronically implanted electrodes. The recorded spike trains were computer scanned for bursts of spikes, and the bursts were catalogued and studied. The firing rates of the neurons ranged from 0.16 to 32 spikes/s; the mean was 8.9 spikes/s, the standard deviation 7.0 spikes/s. Bursts of spikes were assigned a quantitative measure, termed Poisson surprise (S), defined as the negative logarithm of their probability in a random (Poisson) spike train. Only bursts having S greater than 10, corresponding to an occurrence rate of about 0.01 bursts/1,000 spikes in a random spike train, were considered to be of interest. Bursts having S greater than 10 occurred at a rate of about 5-15 bursts/1,000 spikes, or about 1-5 bursts/min. The rate slightly increased with spike rate; averaging about 2 bursts/min for neurons having 3 spikes/s and about 4.5 bursts/min for neurons having 30 spikes/s. About 21\% of the recorded units emitted significantly fewer bursts than the rest (below 1 burst/1,000 spikes). The percentage of these neurons was independent of spike rate. The spike rate during bursts was found to be about 3-6 times the average spike rate; about the same for longer as for shorter bursts. Bursts typically contained 10-50 spikes and lasted 0.5-2.0 s. When the number of spikes in the successively emitted bursts was listed, it was found that in some neurons these numbers were not distributed at random but were clustered around one or more preferred values. In this sense, bursts occasionally "recurred" a few times in a few minutes. The finding suggests that neurons are highly reliable. When bursts of two or more simultaneously recorded neurons were compared, the bursts often appeared to be temporally close, especially between pairs of neurons recorded by the same electrode; but bursts seldom started and ended simultaneously on two channels. Recurring bursts emitted by one neuron were occasionally accompanied by time-locked recurring bursts by other neurons.},

  abstract = {The olfactory bulb differs from other brain regions by its use of bidirectional synaptic transmission at dendrodendritic reciprocal synapses. These reciprocal synapses provide tight coupling of inhibitory feedback from granule cell interneurons to mitral cell projection neurons in the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB), at the first stage of vomeronasal processing. It has been proposed that both the mGluR2 agonist DCG-IV and noradrenaline promote mate recognition memory formation by reducing GABAergic feedback on mitral cells. The resultant mitral cell disinhibition is thought to induce a long-lasting enhancement in the gain of inhibitory feedback from granule to mitral cells, which selectively gates the transmission of the learned chemosensory information. However, we found that local infusions of both noradrenaline and DCG-IV failed to disinhibit AOB neural activity in urethane-anaesthetised mice. DCG-IV infusion had similar effects to the GABA(A) agonist isoguvacine, suggesting that it increased GABAergic inhibition in the AOB rather than reducing it. Noradrenaline infusion into the AOB also failed to disinhibit mitral cells in awake mice despite inducing long-term increases in power of AOB local field potentials, similar to those observed following memory formation. These results suggest that mitral cell disinhibition is not essential for the neural changes in the AOB that underlie mate recognition memory formation in mice.},

While the first generation of epigenetic biomarkers of aging were developed using chronological age as a surrogate for biological age, we hypothesized that incorporation of composite clinical measures of phenotypic age that capture differences in lifespan and healthspan may identify novel CpGs and facilitate the development of a more powerful epigenetic biomarker of aging. Using an innovative two-step process, we develop a new epigenetic biomarker of aging, DNAm PhenoAge, that strongly outperforms previous measures in regards to predictions for a variety of aging outcomes, including all-cause mortality, cancers, healthspan, physical functioning, and Alzheimer's disease. While this biomarker was developed using data from whole blood, it correlates strongly with age in every tissue and cell tested. Based on an in-depth transcriptional analysis in sorted cells, we find that increased epigenetic, relative to chronological age, is associated with increased activation of pro-inflammatory and interferon pathways, and decreased activation of transcriptional/translational machinery, DNA damage response, and mitochondrial signatures. Overall, this single epigenetic biomarker of aging is able to capture risks for an array of diverse outcomes across multiple tissues and cells, and provide insight into important pathways in aging.},

  abstract = {Burst firing of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta can be induced in vitro by the glutamate agonist N-methyl-d-aspartate. It has been suggested that the interburst hyperpolarization is due to Na+ extrusion by a ouabain-sensitive pump [Johnson et al. (1992)Science258, 665–667]. We formulate and explore a theoretical model, with a minimal number of currents, for this novel mechanism of burst generation. This minimal model is further developed into a more elaborate model based on observations of additional currents and hypotheses about their spatial distribution in dopaminergic neurons [Hounsgaard (1992)Neuroscience50, 513–518; Llinás et al. (1984)Brain Res.294, 127–132]. Using the minimal model, we confirm that interaction between the regenerative, inward N-methyl-d-aspartate-mediated current and the outward Na+-pump current is sufficient to generate the slow oscillation (∼0.5 Hz) underlying the burst. The negative-slope region of the N-methyl-d-aspartate channel's current-voltage relation is indispensable for this slow rhythm generation. The time-scale of Na+-handling determines the burst's slow frequency. Moreover, we show that, given the constraints of sodium handling, such bursting is best explained mechanistically by using at least two spatial, cable-like compartments: a soma where action potentials are produced and a dendritic compartment where the slow rhythm is generated. Our result is consistent with recent experimental evidence that burst generation originates in distal dendrites [Seutin et al. (1994)Neuroscience58, 201–206]. Responses of the model to a number of electrophysiological and pharmacological stimuli are consistent with known responses observed under similar conditions. These include the persistence of the slow rhythm when the tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na+ channel is blocked and when the soma is voltage-clamped at -60 mV. Using our more elaborate model, we account for details of the observed frequency adaptation in N-methyl-d-aspartate-induced bursting, the origin of multiple spiking and bursting mechanisms, and the interaction between two different bursting mechanisms. Besides reproducing several well established firing patterns, this model also suggests that new firing modes, not yet recorded, might also occur in dopaminergic neurons. This model provides mechanistic insights and explanations into the origin of a variety of experimentally observed membrane potential firing patterns in dopaminergic neurons, including N-methyl-d-aspartate-induced bursting and its dendritic origin. Such a model, capable of reproducing a number of realistic behaviors of dopaminergic neurons, could be useful in further studies of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical motor circuit. It may also shed light on bursting that involves N-methyl-d-aspartate channel activity in other neuron types.},

  abstract = {Given gut microbiota's important role in human health, a clear understanding of the microbial ecosystem dynamics is vital. Mathematical models for analyzing time-series data of gut microbiotas would, therefore, be highly beneficial. Although a generalized Lotka–Volterra (gLV) model for identifying the interactions between gut microbiota members and quantifying the effects of external factors already exists, it is limited in its practical applications. Therefore, we established a stochastic gLV model for analyzing temporal data about the gut microbiota from a local community perspective and provided a reliable parameter estimation method for our model. Our model has abilities similar to those of the existing gLV model but can also capture emigration/immigration effects and avoid the existing model's inadequacies. To test our model's applicability, we fitted our model on a previously published data set. We found the interactions between the gut microbiota of different individuals and between different periods for the same individual were different in the data sets. Analysis of the random dynamic characteristics of the gut microbiota revealed that the number of microorganisms in the local community tended to decrease as a result of random factors, but the numbers were restored by the immigration of external microbes .},

In this work, a generative adversarial network (GAN) model is proposed to improve the discrimination power of GMHI. Built based on the batch corrected data through GAN, GAN-GMHI has largely reduced the batch effects, and profoundly improved the performance for distinguishing healthy individuals and different diseases. GAN-GMHI has provided a solution to unravel the strong association of gut microbiome and diseases, and indicated a more accurate venue toward microbiome-based disease monitoring. The code for GAN-GMHI is available at https://github.com/HUST-NingKang-Lab/GAN-GMHI. Importance The association of gut microbiome and diseases has been proven for many diseases, while the transformation of such association to a robust and universal disease prediction model has remained illusive, largely due to the batch effects presents in multiple microbiome cohorts. Our analyses have indicated a plausible venue, which is based on GAN technique, towards batch effect removal for microbiome datasets. GAN-GMHI is a novel method built based on the batch corrected data through GAN, as well as GMHI for prediction of a broad-spectrum of diseases.},

Strategies designed for genomic data to mitigate batch effects usually fail to address the zero-inflated and over-dispersed microbiome data. Most strategies tailored for microbiome data are restricted to association testing or specialized study designs, failing to allow other analytic goals or general designs. Here, we develop the Conditional Quantile Regression (ConQuR) approach to remove microbiome batch effects using a two-part quantile regression model. ConQuR is a comprehensive method that accommodates the complex distributions of microbial read counts by non-parametric modeling, and it generates batch-removed zero-inflated read counts that can be used in and benefit usual subsequent analyses. We apply ConQuR to simulated and real microbiome datasets and demonstrate its advantages in removing batch effects while preserving the signals of interest.},

The proposed KRV framework improves statistical power by capturing intrinsic structure within the genetic and microbiome data while reducing the multiple-testing burden. We apply the covariate-adjusted KRV test to the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos in a genome-wide association analysis (first gene-level, then variant-level) for microbiome beta-diversity. We have identified an immunity-related gene, IL23R, reported in previous association studies and discovered 3 other novel genes, 2 of which are involved in immune functions or autoimmune disorders. Our findings highlight the value of the KRV as a powerful microbiome GWAS approach and support an important role of immunity-related genes in shaping the gut microbiome composition.},

We identified 58 causal relationships between the gut microbiome and blood metabolites, and replicated 43 of them. Increased relative abundances of fecal Oscillibacter and Alistipes were causally linked to decreased triglyceride concentration. Conversely, blood metabolites such as glutamic acid appeared to decrease fecal Oxalobacter, and members of Proteobacteria were influenced by metabolites such as 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid, alanine, glutamate and selenium. Two-sample Mendelian randomization with data from Biobank Japan partly corroborated results with triglyceride and with uric acid, and also provided causal support for published fecal bacterial markers for cancer and cardiovascular diseases. This study illustrates the value of human genetic information to help prioritize gut microbial features for mechanistic and clinical studies.},

  abstract = {Aging is often perceived as a degenerative process resulting from random accrual of cellular damage over time. Despite this, age can be accurately estimated by epigenetic clocks based on DNA methylation profiles from almost any tissue of the body. Since such pan-tissue epigenetic clocks have been successfully developed for several different species, we hypothesized that one can build pan-mammalian clocks that measure age in all mammalian species. To address this, we generated data using 11,754 methylation arrays, each profiling up to 36 thousand cytosines in highly-conserved stretches of DNA, from 59 tissue-types derived from 185 mammalian species. From these methylation profiles, we constructed three age predictors, each with a single mathematical formula, termed universal pan-mammalian clocks that are accurate in estimating the age (r{$>$}0.96) of any mammalian tissue. Deviations between epigenetic age and chronological age relate to mortality risk in humans, mutations that affect the somatotropic axis in mice, and caloric restriction. We characterized specific cytosines, whose methylation levels change with age across most mammalian species. These cytosines are greatly enriched in polycomb repressive complex 2-binding sites, are located in regions that gradually lose chromatin accessibility with age and are proximal to genes that play a role in mammalian development, cancer, human obesity, and human longevity. Collectively, these results support the notion that aging is indeed evolutionarily conserved and coupled to developmental processes across all mammalian species - a notion that was long-debated without the benefit of this new compelling evidence. SUMMARY This study identifies and characterizes evolutionarily conserved cytosines implicated in the aging process across mammals and establishes pan mammalian epigenetic clocks.},

This consists of separating the state variables into fast and slow categories. (2) The dynamics of the fast variables are analysed first, holding the slow variables fixed. Then the dynamics of the slow variables are analysed, with the fast variables held at corresponding equilibrium values. If there are several such equilibria, there are several possibilities for the slow dynamics. (3) In the case of the budworm, this analysis exhibits the possibility of `relaxation oscillations' which are familiar from theory of the Van der Pol oscillator. In more modern terminology, the jumps of the system are governed by a cusp catastrophe. (4) Such an analysis can be made on the basis of qualitative information only, but additional insight emerges when parameter ranges are defined by the kind of information typically available from an experienced biologist. (5) At the least this can be a guide to assess subsequent priorities for both research and policy.},

A three-neuron central pattern generator (CPG) whose sufficiency and necessity have been demonstrated mediates this behaviour. Aerial respiration, while an important homeostatic behaviour, is inhibited by the activation of the whole body withdrawal response that the animal uses to protect itself. We found that it was possible to operantly condition snails not to perform aerial respiration in a situation, a hypoxic environment, where aerial respiration should predominate. Operant conditioning was achieved by eliciting the pneumostome withdrawal response, part of the whole body withdrawal response, each time the animal attempted to open its pneumostome to breathe. Yoked control animals did not demonstrate an alteration in breathing behaviour. Subsequently we determined neural correlates of this associative behaviour and found that neuronal changes are distributed throughout the CPG. This preparation may afford us the opportunity to determine the casual neuronal changes that underlie learning and memory of associative conditioning.},

However, identifying and representing these eigenfunctions has proven challenging. This work leverages deep learning to discover representations of Koopman eigenfunctions from data. Our network is parsimonious and interpretable by construction, embedding the dynamics on a low-dimensional manifold. We identify nonlinear coordinates on which the dynamics are globally linear using a modified auto-encoder. We also generalize Koopman representations to include a ubiquitous class of systems with continuous spectra. Our framework parametrizes the continuous frequency using an auxiliary network, enabling a compact and efficient embedding, while connecting our models to decades of asymptotics. Thus, we benefit from the power of deep learning, while retaining the physical interpretability of Koopman embeddings.},

  abstract = {Two-photon calcium imaging enables functional analysis of neuronal circuits by inferring action potential (AP) occurrence (“spike trains”) from cellular fluorescence signals. It remains unclear how experimental parameters such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and acquisition rate affect spike inference and whether additional information about network structure can be extracted. Here we present a simulation framework for quantitatively assessing how well spike dynamics and network topology can be inferred from noisy calcium imaging data. For simulated AP-evoked calcium transients in neocortical pyramidal cells, we analyzed the quality of spike inference as a function of SNR and data acquisition rate using a recently introduced peeling algorithm. Given experimentally attainable values of SNR and acquisition rate, neural spike trains could be reconstructed accurately and with up to millisecond precision. We then applied statistical neuronal network models to explore how remaining uncertainties in spike inference affect estimates of network connectivity and topological features of network organization. We define the experimental conditions suitable for inferring whether the network has a scale-free structure and determine how well hub neurons can be identified. Our findings provide a benchmark for future calcium imaging studies that aim to reliably infer neuronal network properties.},

Microbiome data are typically characterized by zero inflation, overdispersion, high dimensionality, and sample heterogeneity. Three popular areas of interest in microbiome research requiring statistical methods that can account for the characterizations of microbiome data include detecting differentially abundant taxa across phenotype groups, identifying associations between the microbiome and covariates, and constructing microbiome networks to characterize ecological associations of microbes. These three areas are referred to as differential abundance analysis, integrative analysis, and network analysis, respectively. In this review, we highlight available statistical methods for differential abundance analysis, integrative analysis, and network analysis that have greatly advanced microbiome research. In addition, we discuss each method's motivation, modeling framework, and application.},

  abstract = {Whether drugs that enhance cognition in healthy individuals will appear in the near future has become a topic of considerable interest. We address this possibility using a three variable system (psychological effect, neurobiological mechanism, efficiency vs. capabilities) for classifying candidates. Ritalin and modafinil, two currently available compounds, operate on primary psychological states that in turn affect cognitive operations (attention, memory), but there is little evidence that these effects translate into improvements in complex cognitive processing. A second category of potential enhancers includes agents that improve memory encoding, generally without large changes in primary psychological states. Unfortunately, there is little information on how these compounds affect cognitive performance in standard psychological tests. Recent experiments have identified a number of sites at which memory drugs could, in principle, manipulate the cell biological systems underlying the learning-related long-term potentiation (LTP) effect; this may explain the remarkable diversity of memory promoting compounds. Indeed, many of these agents are known to have positive effects on LTP. A possible third category of enhancement drugs directed specifically at integrated cognitive operations is nearly empty. From a neurobiological perspective, two plausible candidate classes have emerged that both target the fast excitatory transmission responsible for communication within cortical networks. One acts on nicotinic receptors (alpha7, alpha4) that regulate release of the neurotransmitter glutamate while the other (`ampakines') allosterically modulates the glutamate receptors mediating the post-synaptic response (EPSCs). Brain imaging in primates has shown that ampakines expand cortical networks engaged by a complex task; coupled with behavioral data, these findings provide evidence for the possibility of generating new cognitive capabilities. Finally, we suggest that continuing advances in behavioral sciences provide new opportunities for translational work, and that discussions of the social impact of cognitive enhancers have failed to consider the distinction between effects on efficiency vs. new capabilities.},

To date, transcriptomic data is the second most abundant omics data type following genomics. To deconvolute the relationship between transcriptomic changes and aging one needs to conduct an analysis on the comprehensive dataset. At the same time, biological aging clocks constructed for clinical use needs to robustly predict new data without any further retraining. In this paper, we develop a transcriptomic deep-learned age predictor. Deep neural networks (DNN) are trained and tested on more than 6 000 blood gene expression samples from 17 datasets. We apply methods based on output derivatives of DNN to rank input genes by their importance in age prediction and reduce the dimensional of the data. We also show that batch effect in transcriptome datasets of healthy humans is indeed significant, but the existing normalization techniques, while removing technical variation quite effectively, also remove age-associated changes. So robust methods of age prediction are needed.},

Morphogenetic cell rearrangements such as cell sorting and mutual tissue spreading have been compared with the behaviors of immiscible liquids, which they closely resemble. Based on this similarity, it has been proposed that tissues behave as liquids and possess a characteristic surface tension, which arises as a collective, macroscopic property of groups of mobile, cohering cells. But how are tissue surface tensions generated? Different theories have been proposed to explain how mesoscopic cell properties such as cell–cell adhesion and contractility of cell interfaces may underlie tissue surface tensions. Although recent work suggests that both may be contributors, an explicit model for the dependence of tissue surface tension on these mesoscopic parameters has been missing. Here we show explicitly that the ratio of adhesion to cortical tension determines tissue surface tension. Our minimal model successfully explains the available experimental data and makes predictions, based on the feedback between mechanical energy and geometry, about the shapes of aggregate surface cells, which we verify experimentally. This model indicates that there is a crossover from adhesion dominated to cortical-tension dominated behavior as a function of the ratio between these two quantities.},

Computational and experimental studies of single-neuron and network homeostatic regulation have provided insight into compensatory mechanisms that can underlie stable network performance.

Such multistability of the neuronal dynamics has in fact been shown in a variety of neurons and can play either a functional role or present a substrate for neurological diseases. We explored the propensity for multistability in a database of a leech heart interneuron model, testing each case (parameter set) in a database for multistability. We found a large proportion of multistable cases, especially the coexistence of silent and bursting regimes. This was a surprising result, since these cells pace the heartbeat of the leech, and the coexistence of silence and bursting could disrupt the functional pattern, threatening the viability of the leech. Analysis of networks of mutually inhibitory multistable neurons, however, showed robustness in maintaining functional activity, suggesting that the mutually inhibitory coupling can act as a protective mechanism against failures induced by multistability.},

  abstract = {Unraveling the mechanisms underlying oscillatory behavior is critical for understanding normal and pathological brain processes. Here we used electrophysiology in mouse neocortical slices and principles of nonlinear dynamics to demonstrate how an increase in the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) conductance can create a nonlinear whole-cell current-voltage ( I – V ) relationship, which leads to changes in cellular stability. We discovered two behaviorally and morphologically distinct pyramidal cell populations. Under control conditions, both cell types responded to depolarizing current injection with regular spiking patterns. However, upon NMDAR activation, an intrinsic oscillatory (IO) cell type (n = 44) showed a nonlinear whole-cell I – V relationship, intrinsic voltage-dependent oscillations plus amplification of alternating input current, and these properties persisted after disabling action potential generation with TTX. The other non-oscillatory (NO) neuronal population (n = 24) demonstrated none of these behaviors., Simultaneous intra- and extracellular recordings demonstrated the NMDAR's capacity to promote low-frequency seizure-like network oscillations via its effects on intrinsic neuronal properties. The two pyramidal cell types demonstrated different relationships with network oscillation: the IO cells were leaders that were activated early in the population activity cycle while the activation of the NO cell type was distributed across network bursts. The properties of IO neurons disappeared in a low magnesium environment where the voltage-dependence of the receptor is abolished; concurrently, the cellular contribution to network oscillation switched to synchronous firing. Thus, depending upon the efficacy of NMDAR in altering the linearity of the whole-cell current-voltage relationship, the two cell populations played different roles in sustaining network oscillation.},

A genetically identified population of ventromedial interneurons, called Hb9, in the mouse spinal cord has been shown to generate TTX-resistant membrane potential oscillations in the presence of NMDA, serotonin and dopamine, but these oscillatory properties are not well characterized. Hb9 interneurons are rhythmically active during fictive locomotor-like behavior. In this study, we report that exogenous N-Methyl-D-Aspartic acid (NMDA) application is sufficient to produce membrane potential oscillations in Hb9 interneurons. In contrast, exogenous serotonin and dopamine application, alone or in combination, are not sufficient. The properties of NMDA-induced oscillations vary among the Hb9 interneuron population; their frequency and amplitude increase with increasing NMDA concentration. NMDA does not modulate the T-type calcium current (ICa(T)), which is thought to be important in generating locomotor-like activity, in Hb9 neurons. These results suggest that NMDA receptor activation is sufficient for the generation of TTX-resistant NMDA-induced membrane potential oscillations in Hb9 interneurons.},

  abstract = {Out-of-phase bursting is a functionally important behavior displayed by central pattern generators and other neural circuits. Understanding this complex activity requires the knowledge of the interplay between the intrinsic cell properties and the properties of synaptic coupling between the cells. Here we describe a simple method that allows us to investigate the existence and stability of anti-phase bursting solutions in a network of two spiking neurons, each possessing a T-type calcium current and coupled by reciprocal inhibition. We derive a one-dimensional map which fully characterizes the genesis and regulation of anti-phase bursting arising from the interaction of the T-current properties with the properties of synaptic inhibition. This map is the burst length return map formed as the composition of two distinct one-dimensional maps that are each regulated by a different set of model parameters. Although each map is constructed using the properties of a single isolated model neuron, the composition of the two maps accurately captures the behavior of the full network. We analyze the parameter sensitivity of these maps to determine the influence of both the intrinsic cell properties and the synaptic properties on the burst length, and to find the conditions under which multistability of several bursting solutions is achieved. Although the derivation of the map relies on a number of simplifying assumptions, we discuss how the principle features of this dimensional reduction method could be extended to more realistic model networks.},

  abstract = {Current practice in the normalization of microbiome count data is inefficient in the statistical sense. For apparently historical reasons, the common approach is either to use simple proportions (which does not address heteroscedasticity) or to use rarefying of counts, even though both of these approaches are inappropriate for detection of differentially abundant species. Well-established statistical theory is available that simultaneously accounts for library size differences and biological variability using an appropriate mixture model. Moreover, specific implementations for DNA sequencing read count data (based on a Negative Binomial model for instance) are already available in RNA-Seq focused R packages such as edgeR and DESeq. Here we summarize the supporting statistical theory and use simulations and empirical data to demonstrate substantial improvements provided by a relevant mixture model framework over simple proportions or rarefying. We show how both proportions and rarefied counts result in a high rate of false positives in tests for species that are differentially abundant across sample classes. Regarding microbiome sample-wise clustering, we also show that the rarefying procedure often discards samples that can be accurately clustered by alternative methods. We further compare different Negative Binomial methods with a recently-described zero-inflated Gaussian mixture, implemented in a package called metagenomeSeq. We find that metagenomeSeq performs well when there is an adequate number of biological replicates, but it nevertheless tends toward a higher false positive rate. Based on these results and well-established statistical theory, we advocate that investigators avoid rarefying altogether. We have provided microbiome-specific extensions to these tools in the R package, phyloseq.},

  abstract = {Distinct niches of the mammalian gut are populated by diverse microbiota, but the contribution of spatial variation to intestinal metabolism remains unclear. Here we present a map of the longitudinal metabolome along the gut of healthy colonized and germ-free male mice. With this map, we reveal a general shift from amino acids in the small intestine to organic acids, vitamins and nucleotides in the large intestine. We compare the metabolic landscapes in colonized versus germ-free mice to disentangle the origin of many metabolites in different niches, which in some cases allows us to infer the underlying processes or identify the producing species. Beyond the known impact of diet on the small intestinal metabolic niche, distinct spatial patterns suggest specific microbial influence on the metabolome in the small intestine. Thus, we present a map of intestinal metabolism and identify metabolite–microbe associations, which provide a basis to connect the spatial occurrence of bioactive compounds to host or microorganism metabolism.},

  date = {2014},
  abstract = {In this thesis we model two very different movement-related neuronal circuits, both of which produce oscillatory patterns of activity. In one case we study oscillatory activity in the basal ganglia under both normal and Parkinsonian conditions. First, we used a detailed Hodgkin-Huxley type spiking model to investigate the activity patterns that arise when oscillatory cortical input is transmitted to the globus pallidus via the subthalamic nucleus. Our model reproduced a result from rodent studies which shows that two anti-phase oscillatory groups of pallidal neurons appear under Parkinsonian conditions. Secondly, we used a population model of the basal ganglia to study whether oscillations could be locally generated. The basal ganglia are thought to be organised into multiple parallel channels. In our model, isolated channels could not generate oscillations, but if the lateral inhibition between channels is sufficiently strong then the network can act as a rhythm-generating “pacemaker” circuit. This was particularly true when we used a set of connection strength parameters that represent the basal ganglia under Parkinsonian conditions. Since many things are not known about the anatomy and electrophysiology of the basal ganglia, we also studied oscillatory activity in another, much simpler, movement-related neuronal system: the spinal cord of the Xenopus tadpole. We built a computational model of the spinal cord containing approximately 1,500 biologically realistic Hodgkin-Huxley neurons, with synaptic connectivity derived from a computational model of axon growth. The model produced physiological swimming behaviour and was used to investigate which aspects of axon growth and neuron dynamics are behaviourally important. We found that the oscillatory attractor associated with swimming was remarkably stable, which suggests that, surprisingly, many features of axonal growth and synapse formation are not necessary for swimming to emerge. We also studied how the same spinal cord network can generate a different oscillatory pattern in which neurons on both sides of the body fire synchronously. Our results here suggest that under normal conditions the synchronous state is unstable or weakly stable, but that even small increases in spike transmission delays act to stabilise it. Finally, we found that although the basal ganglia and the tadpole spinal cord are very different systems, the underlying mechanism by which they can produce oscillations may be remarkably similar. Insights from the tadpole model allow us to predict how the basal ganglia model may be capable of producing multiple patterns of oscillatory activity.},

  abstract = {Fasting is increasingly popular to manage metabolic and inflammatory diseases. Despite the role that the human gut microbiota plays in health and diseases, little is known about its composition and functional capacity during prolonged fasting when the external nutrient supply is reduced or suppressed. We analysed the effects of a 10-d periodic fasting on the faecal microbiota of fifteen healthy men. Participants fasted according to the peer-reviewed Buchinger fasting guidelines, which involve a daily energy intake of about 1046 kJ (250 kcal) and an enema every 2 d. Serum biochemistry confirmed the metabolic switch from carbohydrates to fatty acids and ketones. Emotional and physical well-being were enhanced. Faecal 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing showed that fasting caused a decrease in the abundance of bacteria known to degrade dietary polysaccharides such as Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae. There was a concomitant increase in Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria (Escherichia coli and Bilophila wadsworthia), known to use host-derived energy substrates. Changes in taxa abundance were associated with serum glucose and faecal branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), suggesting that fasting-induced changes in the gut microbiota are associated with host energy metabolism. These effects were reversed after 3 months. SCFA levels were unchanged at the end of the fasting. We also monitored intestinal permeability and inflammatory status. IL-6, IL-10, interferon γ and TNFα levels increased when food was reintroduced, suggesting a reactivation of the postprandial immune response. We suggest that changes in the gut microbiota are part of the physiological adaptations to a 10-d periodic fasting, potentially influencing its beneficial health effects.},

In this study, we describe a generalization of the leaky integrate-and-fire model that produces a wide variety of spiking behaviors while still being analytically solvable between firings. For different parameter values, the model produces spiking or bursting, tonic, phasic or adapting responses, depolarizing or hyperpolarizing after potentials and so forth. The model consists of a diagonalizable set of linear differential equations describing the time evolution of membrane potential, a variable threshold, and an arbitrary number of firing-induced currents. Each of these variables is modified by an update rule when the potential reaches threshold. The variables used are intuitive and have biological significance. The model's rich behavior does not come from the differential equations, which are linear, but rather from complex update rules. This single-neuron model can be implemented using algorithms similar to the standard integrate-and-fire model. It is a natural match with event-driven algorithms for which the firing times are obtained as a solution of a polynomial equation.},

Central executive function typically requires instantaneous coordination among the medial prefrontal regions and other distant regions, depending on the on-going task situation. In human scalp-recorded electroencephalography (EEG), the medial prefrontal area is estimated to be the current source of the theta rhythm, while there is no direct evidence that the theta rhythm is involved in the dynamic networking of central executive circuits. Here we hypothesize that the central executive circuit over the prefrontal and task-related cortices is dynamically linked by theta synchronization. By using simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and EEG, we elucidated cortical circuits emerging with theta phase synchronization during free pacing repeated subtraction. Theta phase synchronization in the scalp EEG was found to emerge at two major clusters of electrode pairs, between the right frontal and left parietal sites and between the frontal and right parietal sites. The phase synchronization of two clusters is accompanied by fMRI responses in the cortical regions responsible for central executive function, working memory, visual imagery and cognitive action sequence. Here we report the first evidence that theta phase synchronization dynamically coordinates the central executive circuits, including the medial prefrontal cortex and relevant cortical regions.},

This paper formulates the resource allocation problem in contingency planning as a two-stage stochastic optimization problem with a risk-averse recourse function. The solution method proposed relies on an inexact proximal bundle method with subgradient approximations through a scenario reduction mechanism. The paper extends the inexact oracle to a more general risk-averse setting, and proves that it meets the requirements of the oracle in the inexact bundle method, ensuring convergence to an optimal solution. The practical performance of the developed inexact bundle method under risk aversion is investigated for our resource allocation problem. We create a library of test problems and obtain their optimal values by applying the exact bundle method. The computed solutions from the developed inexact bundle method are compared against these optimal values, under different coherent risk measures. Our analyses indicate that our inexact bundle method significantly reduces the computational time of solving the resource allocation problem in comparison to the exact bundle method, and is capable of achieving a high percentage of optimality within a much shorter time.},

Voltage clamp and frequency domain methods were used to obtain quantitative kinetic data of the voltage dependent ionic channels located both on the soma and on highly branched dendritic membranes. Pressure pulses of NMDA applied to the most peripheral regions of the dendritic tree elicited large somatic impedance increases, indicating that the most peripheral dendrites are well supplied with NMDA receptors. Experiments done with kainate did not elicit somatic responses to agonist applications on peripheral dendrites. The data obtained are consistent with the hypothesis that the activation of NMDA receptors by exogenous glutamate is significantly modified by the simultaneous activation of non-NMDA receptors, which shunts the NMDA response. The non-NMDA shunting hypothesis was tested by a combined application of kainate and NMDA to mimic the action of glutamate showing that the shunting effect of non-NMDA receptor activation virtually abolished the marked voltage dependency typical of NMDA receptor activation. These data were interpreted with a compartmental neuronal model having both NMDA and non-NMDA receptors.},

Methods A total of 63 middle-aged (53 [7] years) individuals with MetS and obesity (BMI = 32.8 [4.5] kg/m2) completed 16 weeks of supervised high-intensity interval training (3 d/wk, 43 min/session). Participants were either taking metformin (EXER+MET; n = 29) or were free of any pharmacological treatment for their MetS factors (EXER; n = 34). Groups were similar in their initial cardiorespiratory fitness (maximal oxygen uptake [VO2MAX]), age, percentage of women, BMI, and MetS factors (z score). The effects of exercise training on IR (homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR]), MetS z score, VO2MAX, maximal fat oxidation during exercise, and maximal aerobic power output were measured. Results Fasting insulin and HOMA-IR decreased similarly in both groups with training (EXER+MET: −4.3\% and −10.6\%; EXER: −5.3\% and −14.5\%; p value for time = 0.005). However, metformin use reduced VO2MAX improvements by half (i.e., EXER+MET: 12.7\%; EXER: 25.3\%; p value for time × group = 0.012). Maximal fat oxidation during exercise increased similarly in both groups (EXER+MET: 20.7\%; EXER: 25.3\%; p value for time = 0.040). VO2MAX gains were not associated with HOMA-IR reductions (EXER+MET: r = −0.098; p = 0.580; EXER: r = −0.255; p = 0.182). Conclusions Metformin use was associated with attenuated VO2MAX improvements but did not affect fasting IR reductions with aerobic training in individuals with hyperglycemia and high cardiovascular risk (i.e., MetS).},

  abstract = {Barnacle muscle fibers subjected to constant current stimulation produce a variety of types of oscillatory behavior when the internal medium contains the Ca++ chelator EGTA. Oscillations are abolished if Ca++ is removed from the external medium, or if the K+ conductance is blocked. Available voltage-clamp data indicate that the cell's active conductance systems are exceptionally simple. Given the complexity of barnacle fiber voltage behavior, this seems paradoxical. This paper presents an analysis of the possible modes of behavior available to a system of two noninactivating conductance mechanisms, and indicates a good correspondence to the types of behavior exhibited by barnacle fiber. The differential equations of a simple equivalent circuit for the fiber are dealt with by means of some of the mathematical techniques of nonlinear mechanics. General features of the system are (a) a propensity to produce damped or sustained oscillations over a rather broad parameter range, and (b) considerable latitude in the shape of the oscillatory potentials. It is concluded that for cells subject to changeable parameters (either from cell to cell or with time during cellular activity), a system dominated by two noninactivating conductances can exhibit varied oscillatory and bistable behavior.},

In this document we review phenomenological models of short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity, in particular spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). The aim of the document is to provide a framework for classifying and evaluating different models of plasticity. We focus on phenomenological synaptic models that are compatible with integrate-and-fire type neuron models where each neuron is described by a small number of variables. This implies that synaptic update rules for short-term or long-term plasticity can only depend on spike timing and, potentially, on membrane potential, as well as on the value of the synaptic weight, or on low-pass filtered (temporally averaged) versions of the above variables. We examine the ability of the models to account for experimental data and to fulfill expectations derived from theoretical considerations. We further discuss their relations to teacher-based rules (supervised learning) and reward-based rules (reinforcement learning). All models discussed in this paper are suitable for large-scale network simulations.},

Some of the earliest—and clearest—experimental tests of these models were famously conducted by Georgy Gause in the 1930s. Although well known, the data from these experiments are not widely available and are often difficult to analyze using standard statistical and computational tools. Point 2: Here, we introduce the gauseR package, a collection of tools for fitting Lotka-Volterra models to time series data of one or more species. The package includes several methods for parameter estimation and optimization, and includes 42 datasets from Gause's species interaction experiments and related work. Additionally, we include with this paper a short blog post discussing the historical importance of these data and models, and an R vignette with a walk-through introducing the package methods. The package is available for download at github.com/adamtclark/gauseR. Point 3: To demonstrate the package, we apply it to several classic experimental studies from Gause, as well as two other well-known datasets on multi-trophic dynamics on Isle Royale, and in spatially structured mite populations. In almost all cases, models fit observations closely and fitted parameter values make ecological sense. Point 4: Taken together, we hope that the methods, data, and analyses that we present here provide a simple and user-friendly way to interact with complex ecological data. We are optimistic that these methods will be especially useful to students and educators who are studying ecological dynamics, as well as researchers who would like a fast tool for basic analyses.},

  abstract = {Summary Recent advances in fluorescence imaging permit studies of Ca2+ dynamics in large numbers of cells, in anesthetized and awake behaving animals. However, unlike for electrophysiological signals, standardized algorithms for assigning optically recorded signals to individual cells have not yet emerged. Here, we describe an automated sorting procedure that combines independent component analysis and image segmentation for extracting cells' locations and their dynamics with minimal human supervision. In validation studies using simulated data, automated sorting significantly improved estimation of cellular signals compared to conventional analysis based on image regions of interest. We used automated procedures to analyze data recorded by two-photon Ca2+ imaging in the cerebellar vermis of awake behaving mice. Our analysis yielded simultaneous Ca2+ activity traces for up to \&gt;100 Purkinje cells and Bergmann glia from single recordings. Using this approach, we found microzones of Purkinje cells that were stable across behavioral states and in which synchronous Ca2+ spiking rose significantly during locomotion.},

  abstract = {Parameter optimization methods were used to quantitatively analyze frequency-domain-voltage-clamp data of NMDA-activated lamprey spinal neurons simultaneously over a wide range of membrane potentials. A neuronal cable model was used to explicitly take into account receptors located on the dendritic trees. The driving point membrane admittance was measured from the cell soma in response to a Fourier synthesized point voltage clamp stimulus. The data were fitted to an equivalent cable model consisting of a single lumped soma compartment coupled resistively to a series of equal dendritic compartments. The model contains voltage-dependent NMDA sensitive (INMDA), slow potassium (IK), and leakage (IL) currents. Both the passive cable properties and the voltage dependence of ion channel kinetics were estimated, including the electrotonic structure of the cell, the steady-state gating characteristics, and the time constants for particular voltage- and time-dependent ionic conductances. An alternate kinetic formulation was developed that consisted of steady-state values for the gating parameters and their time constants at half-activation values as well as slopes of these parameters at half-activation. This procedure allowed independent restrictions on the magnitude and slope of both the steady-state gating variable and its associated time constant. Quantitative estimates of the voltage-dependent membrane ion conductances and their kinetic parameters were used to solve the nonlinear equations describing dynamic responses. The model accurately predicts current clamp responses and is consistent with experimentally measured TTX-resistant NMDA-induced patterned activity. In summary, an analysis method is developed that provides a pragmatic approach to quantitatively describe a nonlinear neuronal system.},

  abstract = {Synaptic depression is a form of short-term plasticity exhibited by many synapses. Nonetheless, the functional significance of synaptic depression in oscillatory networks is not well understood. We show that, in a recurrent inhibitory network that includes an intrinsic oscillator, synaptic depression can give rise to two distinct modes of network operation. When the maximal conductance of the depressing synapse is small, the oscillation period is determined by the oscillator component. Increasing the maximal conductance beyond a threshold value activates a positive-feedback mechanism that greatly enhances the synaptic strength. In this mode, the oscillation period is determined by the strength and dynamics of the depressing synapse. Because of the regenerative nature of the feedback mechanism, the circuit can be switched from one mode of operation to another by a very small change in the maximal conductance of the depressing synapse. Our model was inspired by experimental work on the pyloric network of the lobster. The pyloric network produces a simple motor rhythm generated by a pacemaker neuron that receives feedback inhibition from a depressing synapse. In some preparations, elimination of the synapse had no effect on the period of the rhythm, whereas in other preparations, there was a significant decrease in the period. We propose that the pyloric network can operate in either of the two modes suggested by the model, depending on the maximal conductance of the depressing synapse.},

We show that this model generates multiple firing patterns depending on the choice of parameter values, and present a phase diagram describing the transition from one firing type to another. We give an analytical criterion to distinguish between continuous adaption, initial bursting, regular bursting and two types of tonic spiking. Also, we report that the deterministic model is capable of producing irregular spiking when stimulated with constant current, indicating low-dimensional chaos. Lastly, the simple model is fitted to real experiments of cortical neurons under step current stimulation. The results provide support for the suitability of simple models such as the adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire neuron for large network simulations.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between mathematical giftedness, intelligent quotient (IQ), and the microstructure of white matter tracts in a sample composed of math-gifted adolescents and aged-matched controls. Math-gifted subjects were selected through a national program based on detecting enhanced visuospatial abilities and creative thinking. We used diffusion tensor imaging to assess white matter microstructure in neuroanatomical connectivity. The processing included voxel-wise and region of interest-based analyses of the fractional anisotropy (FA), a parameter which is purportedly related to white matter microstructure. In a whole-sample analysis, IQ showed a significant positive correlation with FA, mainly in the corpus callosum, supporting the idea that efficient information transfer between hemispheres is crucial for higher intellectual capabilities. In addition, math-gifted adolescents showed increased FA (adjusted for IQ) in white matter tracts connecting frontal lobes with basal ganglia and parietal regions. The enhanced anatomical connectivity observed in the forceps minor and splenium may underlie the greater fluid reasoning, visuospatial working memory, and creative capabilities of these children.

Huxley equation is an evolution equation that describes the nerve propagation in biology. It is often useful to obtain a generalized solitary solution for fully understanding its physical meanings. It is shown that the solution produced by the Exp-function method may not hold for all initial conditions. It is proven that the analytical condition describing the existence of the produced solution in the space of initial conditions (or even in the space of the system's parameters) can not be derived by the Exp-function method because the question about the existence of that solution is omitted. The proposed operator method, on the contrary, brings the load of symbolic computations before the structure of the solution is identified. The method for the derivation of the solution is based on the concept of the rank of the Hankel matrix constructed from the sequence of coefficients representing formal solution in the series form. Moreover, the structure of the algebraic-analytic solution is generated automatically together with all conditions of the solution's existence. Computational experiments are used to illustrate the properties of derived analytical solutions.},

  abstract = {Recently, a class of two-dimensional integrate and fire models has been used to faithfully model spiking neurons. This class includes the Izhikevich model, the adaptive exponential integrate and fire model, and the quartic integrate and fire model. The bifurcation types for the individual neurons have been thoroughly analyzed by Touboul (SIAM J Appl Math 68(4):1045–1079, 2008). However, when the models are coupled together to form networks, the networks can display bifurcations that an uncoupled oscillator cannot. For example, the networks can transition from firing with a constant rate to burst firing. This paper introduces a technique to reduce a full network of this class of neurons to a mean field model, in the form of a system of switching ordinary differential equations. The reduction uses population density methods and a quasi-steady state approximation to arrive at the mean field system. Reduced models are derived for networks with different topologies and different model neurons with biologically derived parameters. The mean field equations are able to qualitatively and quantitatively describe the bifurcations that the full networks display. Extensions and higher order approximations are discussed.},

Four identified pairs of heart interneurons make a staggered pattern of inhibitory synaptic connections with segmental heart motor neurons. Using extracellular recording from multiple interneurons in the network in 56 isolated nerve cords, we show that this pattern generator produces a side-to-side asymmetric pattern of intersegmental coordination among ipsilateral premotor interneurons. This pattern corresponds to a similarly asymmetric fictive motor pattern in heart motor neurons and asymmetric constriction pattern of the two tubular hearts, synchronous and peristaltic. We provide a quantitative description of the firing pattern of all the premotor interneurons, including phase, duty cycle, and intraburst frequency of this premotor activity pattern. This analysis identifies two stereotypical coordination modes corresponding to synchronous and peristaltic, which show phase constancy over a broad range of periods as do the fictive motor pattern and the heart constriction pattern. Coordination mode is controlled through one segmental pair of heart interneurons (switch interneurons). Side-to-side switches in coordination mode are a regular feature of this pattern generator and occur with changes in activity state of these switch interneurons. Associated with synchronous coordination of premotor interneurons, the ipsilateral switch interneuron is in an active state, during which it produces rhythmic bursts, whereas associated with peristaltic coordination, the ipsilateral switch interneuron is largely silent. We argue that timing and pattern elaboration are separate functions produced by overlapping subnetworks in the heartbeat central pattern generator.},

We tested the hypothesis in a detailed dynamical analysis of a minimal inhibitory neural microcircuit (motif) of three reciprocally connected Hodgkin-Huxley neurons. We reduced this high-dimensional dynamical system to a rate model and showed that both systems have identical bifurcations from tonic spiking to burst generation, which, therefore, does not depend on the details of spiking activity.},

  abstract = {We examine bifurcation phenomena for continuous one-dimensional maps that are piecewise smooth and depend on a parameter 𝜇. In the simplest case, there is a point c at which the map has no derivative (it has two one-sided derivatives). The point c is the border of two intervals in which the map is smooth. As the parameter 𝜇 is varied, a fixed point (or periodic point) E𝜇 may cross the point c, and we may assume that this crossing occurs at 𝜇=0. The investigation of what bifurcations occur at 𝜇=0 reduces to a study of a map f𝜇 depending linearly on 𝜇 and two other parameters a and b. A variety of bifurcations occur frequently in such situations. In particular, E𝜇 may cross the point c, and for 𝜇{$<$}0 there can be a fixed point attractor, and for 𝜇{$>$}0 there may be a period-3 attractor or even a three-piece chaotic attractor which shrinks to E0 as 𝜇→0. More generally, for every integer m≥2, bifurcations from a fixed point attractor to a period-m attractor, a 2m-piece chaotic attractor, an m-piece chaotic attractor, or a one-piece chaotic attractor can occur for piecewise smooth one-dimensional maps. These bifurcations are called border-collision bifurcations. For almost every point in the region of interest in the (a, b)-space, we state explicitly which border-collision bifurcation actually does occur. We believe this phenomenon will be seen in many applications.},

Currently there are several batch evaluation methods like principal component analysis (PCA; mostly based on visual inspection), and sometimes they fail to reveal all of the underlying batch effects. These methods can also lead to the risk of unintentionally correcting biologically interesting factors attributed to batch effects. Here we propose a novel statistical method, finding batch effect (findBATCH), to evaluate batch effect based on probabilistic principal component and covariates analysis (PPCCA). The same framework also provides a new approach to batch correction, correcting batch effect (correctBATCH), which we have shown to be a better approach to traditional PCA-based correction. We demonstrate the utility of these methods using two different examples (breast and colorectal cancers) by merging gene expression data from different studies after diagnosing and correcting for batch effects and retaining the biological effects. These methods, along with conventional visual inspection-based PCA, are available as a part of an R package exploring batch effect (exploBATCH; https://github.com/syspremed/exploBATCH).},

We have used dual whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from the apical dendrite and cell soma of MCs to develop a passive compartmental model based on detailed morphological reconstructions of the same cells. Matching the model to traces recorded in experiments we find: C(m) = 1.91 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 0.20 𝜇F cm(-2), R(m) = 3547 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 1934 Ω cm(2) and R(i) = 173 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 99 Ω cm. We have constructed a six MC gap-junction (GJ) network model of morphologically accurate MCs. These passive parameters (PPs) were then incorporated into the model with Na(+), Kdr, and KA conductances and GJs from Migliore et al. (2005). The GJs were placed in the apical dendrite tuft (ADT) and their conductance adjusted to give a coupling ratio between MCs consistent with experimental findings ( 0.04). Firing at 50 Hz was induced in all six MCs with continuous current injections (0.05-0.07 nA) at 20 locations to the ADT of two of the MCs. It was found that MCs in the network synchronized better when they shared identical PPs rather than using their own PPs for the fit suggesting that the OB may have populations of MCs tuned for synchrony. The addition of calcium-activated potassium channels (iKCa) and L-type calcium channels (iCa(L)) (Bhalla and Bower, 1993) to the model enabled MCs to generate burst firing. However, the GJ coupling was no longer sufficient to synchronize firing. When cells were stimulated by a continuous current injection there was an initial period of asynchronous burst firing followed after 120 ms by synchronous repetitive firing. This occurred as intracellular calcium fell due to reduced iCa(L) activity. The kinetics of one of the iCa(L) gate variables, which had a long activation time constant (τ range 18-150 ms), was responsible for this fall in iCa(L). The model makes predictions about the nature of the kinetics of the calcium current that will need experimental verification.},

  abstract = {Short-term synaptic plasticity is found in many areas of the central nervous system. In the inhibitory half-center central pattern generators involved in locomotion, synaptic depression is believed to act as a burst termination mechanism, allowing networks to generate anti-phase bursting patterns of varying periods. To better understand burst generation in these central pattern generators, we study a minimal network of two neurons coupled through depressing synapses. Depending on the strength of the synaptic conductance between the two neurons, this network can produce symmetric n : n anti-phase bursts, where neurons fire n spikes in alternation, with the period of such solutions increasing with the strength of the synaptic conductance. Relying on the timescale disparity in the model, we reduce the eight-dimensional network equations to a fully-explicit scalar Poincaré burst map. This map tracks the state of synaptic depression from one burst to the next and captures the complex bursting dynamics of the network. Fixed points of this map are associated with stable burst solutions of the full network model, and are created through fold bifurcations of maps. We derive conditions that predict the bifurcations between n : n and (n + 1) : (n + 1) solutions, producing a full bifurcation diagram of the burst cycle period. Predictions of the Poincaré map fit excellently with numerical simulations of the full network model and allow the study of parameter sensitivity for rhythm generation.},

This is done using a detailed analysis of the dynamics of the shape and orientation of individual cells which enables separation of local and global aspects of the tissue behavior. Intriguingly, we find that we can observe irreversible dynamics in the cell geometries but without a change in the entropy associated with those degrees of freedom, showing that there is a flow of energy into those degrees of freedom. Hence, the living system is controlling how the entropy is being produced and partitioned into its different parts.},

  abstract = {Midbrain dopaminergic neurons send numerous projections to cortical and sub-cortical areas, and in a manner dependent upon their activities, diffusely release dopamine (DA) to their targets. Recent experimental studies have shown that DAergic neuronal bursting is associated with a significantly greater degree of DA release than an equivalent tonic activity pattern. Past computational models for DA cell activity relied upon somatodendritic mechanisms in order to generate DA neuronal bursting. However, recent experimental studies indicate that burst firing can be generated somatically with the dendrites silenced. These somatically induced bursts have characteristics consistent with normal bursting, suggesting that a single-compartmental model should be sufficient for generating the observed DA neuronal dynamics. In this work, we introduce such a model for DA neuronal dynamics and demonstrate that this model captures the qualitative behavior of DAergic neuronal dynamics: quiescence, tonic firing and bursting. In our conductance-based approach, the interplay between the L-type calcium and the calcium dependent SK potassium channel provides a scaffold for the underlying oscillation for the pacemaker-like firing patterns. The model includes terms which can selectively block the SK conductance, which would correspond to pharmacological manipulations using the drug apamin. Our modeling studies are in line with experimental evidence that a reduction of the SK conductance often induces DA neuronal bursting. Moreover, our model can reproduce findings that burst firing can be elicited via stimulus driven events, manifested by rises in the amount of NMDA. This model for DA cell activity could be further sculpted to include more detailed second messenger signaling processes in order to elucidate key differences between the two principal classes of midbrain DA neurons: those of the ventral tegmental area and the substantia nigra pars compacta.},

Neural activation was examined in two WM tasks: an item recognition task, which can be mediated by a direct-access retrieval process, and a judgment of recency task that requires a serial search. Dissociations were found in the activation patterns in the hippocampus and in the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) when the probe contained the most recently studied serial position (where a test probe can be matched to the contents of focal attention) compared to when it contained all other positions (where retrieval is required). The data implicate the hippocampus and the LIFG in retrieval from WM, complementing their established role in long-term memory. Results further suggest that the left posterior parietal cortex (LPPC) supports serial retrieval processes that are often required to recover temporal order information. Together, these data suggest that the LPPC, the LIFG, and the hippocampus collectively support WM retrieval. Critically, the reported findings support accounts that posit a distinction between representations maintained in and outside of focal attention, but are at odds with traditional dual-store models that assume distinct mechanisms for short- and long-term memory representations.},

Here we address this controversy by testing the hypothesis that far transfer may depend on near transfer using mediation models in three separate randomized controlled trials (RCTs). In all three RCTs, totalling 460 individuals, performance on untrained N-back tasks (near transfer) mediated transfer to Matrix Reasoning (representing far transfer) despite the lack of an intervention effect in RCTs 2 and 3. Untrained N-back performance also mediated transfer to a working memory composite, which showed a significant intervention effect (RCT 3). These findings support a model of N-back training in which transfer to untrained N-back tasks gates further transfer (at least in the case of working memory at the construct level) and Matrix Reasoning. This model can help adjudicate between the many studies and meta-analyses of working memory training that have provided mixed results but have not examined the relationship between near and far transfer on an individual-differences level.},

The collective can sometimes flow like a fluid or jam and rigidify like a solid. The unjammed-to-jammed transition remains poorly understood, however, and structural properties characterizing these phases remain unknown. Using primary human bronchial epithelial cells, we show that the jamming transition in asthma is linked to cell shape, thus establishing in that system a structural criterion for cell jamming. Surprisingly, the collapse of critical scaling predicts a counter-intuitive relationship between jamming, cell shape and cell–cell adhesive stresses that is borne out by direct experimental observations. Cell shape thus provides a rigorous structural signature for classification and investigation of bronchial epithelial layer jamming in asthma, and potentially in any process in disease or development in which epithelial dynamics play a prominent role.},

Here we report the most advanced survival data and the associated follow-up to our knowledge of age-related alterations in a cohort of grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus, lemurid primate) exposed to a chronic moderate (30\%) caloric restriction. Compared to control animals, caloric restriction extended lifespan by 50\% (from 6.4 to 9.6 years, median survival), reduced aging-associated diseases and preserved loss of brain white matter in several brain regions. However, caloric restriction accelerated loss of grey matter throughout much of the cerebrum. Cognitive and behavioural performances were, however, not modulated by caloric restriction. Thus chronic moderate caloric restriction can extend lifespan and enhance health of a primate, but it affects brain grey matter integrity without affecting cognitive performances.},

It has been repeatedly shown that frontoparietal theta coupling at ∼0° relative phase is associated with recognition, encoding, short-term retention, and planning [1,4,5]; however, a causal link has not been demonstrated so far. Here we used transcranial alternating current stimulation [6,7,8] simultaneously applied at 6 Hz over left prefrontal and parietal cortices with a relative 0° (“synchronized” condition) or 180° (“desynchronized” condition) phase difference or a placebo stimulation condition, whereas healthy subjects performed a delayed letter discrimination task. We show that exogenously induced frontoparietal theta synchronization significantly improves visual memory-matching reaction times as compared to placebo stimulation. In contrast, exogenously induced frontoparietal theta desynchronization deteriorates performance. The present findings provide for the first time evidence of causality of theta phase-coupling of distant cortical areas for cognitive performance in healthy humans. Moreover, the results demonstrate the suitability of transcranial alternating current stimulation to artificially induce coupling or decoupling of behaviorally relevant brain rhythms between segregated cortical regions.},

  abstract = {Occupying the interface between host and environment, host-associated microbes play fundamental roles in nutrient absorption, essential metabolite synthesis, development of the immune system, defence against pathogens and pathogenesis. Microbiota composition and function is rather stable during adulthood, while it dramatically changes during early development, frailty and disease. Ageing is associated with progressive decrease of homeostasis, often resulting in disruption of the physiological balance between host and commensal microbes, ultimately leading to dysbiosis and host demise. Generally, high microbial diversity is associated with health and a youthful state, while low individual microbial diversity and larger inter-individual microbial diversity is associated with ageing and disease states. Different species are equipped with species-specific commensal, symbiotic and pathogenic microbial communities. How and whether the specific host–microbiota consortia co-evolved with host physiology to ensure homeostasis and promote individual fitness remains an open question. In this essay, we propose that the evolution of vertebrate-specific immune adaptations may have enabled the establishment of highly diverse, species-specific commensal microbial communities. We discuss how the maintenance of intact immune surveillance mechanisms, which allow discrimination between commensal and pathogenic bacteria, fail during ageing and lead to the onset of known ageing-related diseases. We discuss how host–microbiota interactions are key to maintaining homeostasis despite external perturbations, but also how they affect a range of host-specific ageing-related phenotypes. This article is part of the theme issue ‘The role of the microbiome in host evolution’.},

Although the existence of neurons with pacemaker-like bursting properties in this network is not questioned, their role in network rhythmogenesis is unresolved. Modeling is ideally suited to address this debate because of the ease with which biophysical parameters of individual cells and network architecture can be manipulated. We modeled the parameter variability of experimental data from pBC bursting pacemaker and nonpacemaker neurons using a modified version of our previously developed pBC neuron and network models. To investigate the role of pacemakers in networkwide rhythmogenesis, we simulated networks of these neurons and varied the fraction of the population made up of pacemakers. For each number of pacemaker neurons, we varied the amount of tonic drive to the network and measured the frequency of synchronous networkwide bursting produced. Both excitatory networks with all-to-all coupling and sparsely connected networks were explored for several levels of synaptic coupling strength. Networks containing only nonpacemakers were able to produce networkwide bursting, but with a low probability of bursting and low input and output ranges. Our results indicate that inclusion of pacemakers in an excitatory network increases robustness of the network by more than tripling the input and output ranges compared with networks containing no pacemakers. The largest increase in dynamic range occurs when the number of pacemakers in the network is greater than 20\% of the population. Experimental tests of our model predictions are proposed.},

  abstract = {Advances in automation and imaging have made it possible to capture a large image dataset that spans multiple experimental batches of data. However, accurate biological comparison across the batches is challenged by batch-to-batch variation (i.e. batch effect) due to uncontrollable experimental noise (e.g. varying stain intensity or cell density). Previous approaches to minimize the batch effect have commonly focused on normalizing the low-dimensional image measurements such as an embedding generated by a neural network. However, normalization of the embedding could suffer from over-correction and alter true biological features (e.g. cell size) due to our limited ability to interpret the effect of the normalization on the embedding space. Although techniques like flat-field correction can be applied to normalize the image values directly, they are limited transformations that handle only simple artifacts due to batch effect.We present a neural network-based batch equalization method that can transfer images from one batch to another while preserving the biological phenotype. The equalization method is trained as a generative adversarial network (GAN), using the StarGAN architecture that has shown considerable ability in style transfer. After incorporating new objectives that disentangle batch effect from biological features, we show that the equalized images have less batch information and preserve the biological information. We also demonstrate that the same model training parameters can generalize to two dramatically different types of cells, indicating this approach could be broadly applicable.https://github.com/tensorflow/gan/tree/master/tensorflow\_gan/examples/starganSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {Background Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has made it possible to determine the sequence and relative abundance of all nucleotides in a biological or environmental sample. A cornerstone of NGS is the quantification of RNA or DNA presence as counts. However, these counts are not counts per se: their magnitude is determined arbitrarily by the sequencing depth, not by the input material. Consequently, counts must undergo normalization prior to use. Conventional normalization methods require a set of assumptions: they assume that the majority of features are unchanged and that all environments under study have the same carrying capacity for nucleotide synthesis. These assumptions are often untestable and may not hold when heterogeneous samples are compared. Results Methods developed within the field of compositional data analysis offer a general solution that is assumption-free and valid for all data. Herein, we synthesize the extant literature to provide a concise guide on how to apply compositional data analysis to NGS count data. Conclusions In highlighting the limitations of total library size, effective library size, and spike-in normalizations, we propose the log-ratio transformation as a general solution to answer the question, “Relative to some important activity of the cell, what is changing?”},

  abstract = {Dynamical modeling of neural systems and brain functions has a history of success over the last half century. This includes, for example, the explanation and prediction of some features of neural rhythmic behaviors. Many interesting dynamical models of learning and memory based on physiological experiments have been suggested over the last two decades. Dynamical models even of consciousness now exist. Usually these models and results are based on traditional approaches and paradigms of nonlinear dynamics including dynamical chaos. Neural systems are, however, an unusual subject for nonlinear dynamics for several reasons: (i) Even the simplest neural network, with only a few neurons and synaptic connections, has an enormous number of variables and control parameters. These make neural systems adaptive and flexible, and are critical to their biological function. (ii) In contrast to traditional physical systems described by well-known basic principles, first principles governing the dynamics of neural systems are unknown. (iii) Many different neural systems exhibit similar dynamics despite having different architectures and different levels of complexity. (iv) The network architecture and connection strengths are usually not known in detail and therefore the dynamical analysis must, in some sense, be probabilistic. (v) Since nervous systems are able to organize behavior based on sensory inputs, the dynamical modeling of these systems has to explain the transformation of temporal information into combinatorial or combinatorial-temporal codes, and vice versa, for memory and recognition. In this review these problems are discussed in the context of addressing the stimulating questions: What can neuroscience learn from nonlinear dynamics, and what can nonlinear dynamics learn from neuroscience?},

This presents a challenge when designing studies with blinded control conditions. Objective The aim of this research was to investigate the role of different transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) parameters, i.e. intensity, frequency, and electrode montage, on the probability, duration and intensity of elicited neurosensory side effects. Methods In a first study, we examined the influence of tACS on sensations of phosphenes, dizziness, pressure, and skin sensation in fifteen healthy subjects, during 8 s of stimulation with different amplitudes (1500 μA, 1000 μA, 500 μA, 250 μA), frequencies (2 Hz, 4 Hz, 8 Hz, 16 Hz, 32 Hz, 64 Hz), and montages (F3/F4, F3/C4, F3/P4, P3/F4, P3/C4, P3/P4). In a second study, ten healthy subjects were exposed to 60 s of tACS (1000 μA, 2 Hz versus 16 Hz, F3/F4 versus P3/P4) and were asked to rate the intensity of sensations every 12 s. Results The first study showed that all stimulation parameters had an influence on the probability and intensity of sensations. Phosphenes were most likely and strongest for frontal montages and higher frequencies. Dizziness was most likely and strongest for parietal montages and at stimulation frequency of 4 Hz. Skin sensations and pressure was more likely when stimulation was performed across central regions and at posterior montages, respectively. The second study also revealed that the probability and the intensity of sensations were neither modified during more extended periods of stimulation nor affected by carry-over effects. Conclusion We demonstrated that the strength and the likelihood of sensations elicited by tACS were specifically modulated by the stimulation parameters. The present work may therefore be instrumental in establishing effective blinding conditions for studies with tACS.},

  abstract = {Respiratory rhythm generation depends on a complex interaction between synaptic and membrane properties of functionally defined neurons. To gain a better understanding of how inhibitory and excitatory synaptic inputs lead to the generation of the respiratory rhythm we analyzed the depolarization pattern of respiratory neurons that were recorded in the transverse slice preparation of mice (P8–22) and the in vivo adult cat. Using voltage-clamp recordings from respiratory neurons and specific antagonists for inhibitory synaptic transmission we demonstrate under in vitro conditions, that inspiratory (n=7) and post-inspiratory neurons (n=13) received concurrent glycinergic and glutamatergic synaptic input during inspiration. A similar conclusion was gained with chloride injections into in vivo respiratory neurons. The inhibitory input was essential not only for generating the characteristic depolarization pattern of respiratory neurons, but also for switching the respiratory rhythm between inspiration and post-inspiration. The generation of the depolarization pattern depends also on intrinsic membrane properties. Negative current injections reveal that excitatory synaptic input was amplified by intrinsic bursting properties in some inspiratory neurons (n=4) recorded in vitro.

  abstract = {Rhythmically active neuronal networks give rise to rhythmic motor activities but also to seemingly non-rhythmic behaviors such as sleep, arousal, addiction, memory and cognition. Many of these networks contain pacemaker neurons. The ability of these neurons to generate bursts of activity intrinsically lies in voltage- and time-dependent ion fluxes resulting from a dynamic interplay among ion channels, second messenger pathways and intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, and is influenced by neuromodulators and synaptic inputs. This complex intrinsic and extrinsic modulation of pacemaker activity exerts a dynamic effect on network activity. The nonlinearity of bursting activity might enable pacemaker neurons to facilitate the onset of excitatory states or to synchronize neuronal ensembles — an interactive process that is intimately regulated by synaptic and modulatory processes.},

The implications for humans can be clarified by randomized controlled trials of CR.To determine CR's feasibility, safety, and effects on predictors of longevity, disease risk factors, and quality of life in nonobese humans aged 21–51 years, 218 persons were randomized to a 2-year intervention designed to achieve 25\% CR or to AL diet. Outcomes were change from baseline resting metabolic rate adjusted for weight change (“RMR residual”) and core temperature (primary); plasma triiodothyronine (T3) and tumor necrosis factor-α (secondary); and exploratory physiological and psychological measures.Body mass index averaged 25.1 (range: 21.9–28.0kg/m2). Eighty-two percent of CR and 95\% of AL participants completed the protocol. The CR group achieved 11.7±0.7 \%CR (mean ± standard error) and maintained 10.4±0.4\% weight loss. Weight change in AL was negligible. RMR residual decreased significantly more in CR than AL at 12 months (p = .04) but not 24 months (M24). Core temperature change differed little between groups. T3 decreased more in CR at M12 and M24 (p \&lt; .001), while tumor necrosis factor-α decreased significantly more only at M24 (p = .02). CR had larger decreases in cardiometabolic risk factors and in daily energy expenditure adjusted for weight change, without adverse effects on quality of life.Sustained CR is feasible in nonobese humans. The effects of the achieved CR on correlates of human survival and disease risk factors suggest potential benefits for aging-related outcomes that could be elucidated by further human studies.},

  abstract = {Cognitive and behavioral functions depend on the activation of stable neuronal assemblies, i.e. distributed groups of co-active neurons within neuronal networks. It is therefore crucial to monitor distributed patterns of activity in real time with single-neuron resolution. Microelectrode recordings allow detection of coincidence between discharges of identified units at high temporal resolution, but are not able to reveal the full spatial pattern of activity in multi-cellular assemblies. Therefore, observation of such distributed sets of neurons is a stronghold of optical techniques, but the required resolution, sensitivity, and speed are still challenging current technology. Here, we report a new approach for monitoring neuronal assemblies, using memory-related network oscillations in rodent hippocampal circuits as a model. The cytosolic calcium-sensitive fluorescent protein GCaMP3.NES was expressed using recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV)-mediated gene transfer in CA3 pyramidal neurons of cultured mouse hippocampal slices. After 14–21 days in culture, field potential recordings revealed spontaneous occurrence of sharp wave-ripple network events during which a fraction of local neurons is coherently activated. Using a custom-built epi-fluorescence microscope we could monitor a field of view of 410 𝜇m × 410 𝜇m with single-neuron optical resolution (20 × objective, 0.4 NA). We developed a highly sensitive and specific wavelet-based method of cell identification allowing simultaneous observation of more than 150 neurons at frame rates of up to 60 Hz. Our recording configuration and image analysis provide a tool to investigate cognition-related activity patterns in the hippocampus and other circuits.},

  abstract = {In larvae of the amphibian, Xenopus laevis, spinal neurons which are active during fictive swimming also display tetrodotoxin-resistant membrane potential oscillations following the coactivation of N-methyl-dl-aspartate (NMDA) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin or 5-HT) receptors ( Scrymgeour-Wedderburn et al. 1997 ;Eur. J. Neurosci., 9, 1473–1482). The oscillations are slow (≈0.5 Hz) compared with swimming (≈7–35 Hz) raising doubt over their contribution to the cycle by cycle depolarizations occurring during swimming. We investigated an alternative: that the intrinsic oscillations modulate swimming activity over many consecutive cycles. Bath application of NMDA induced continuous fictive swimming that differed between embryonic and larval preparations. In 81\% of larval preparations (n = 36), there was a slow (approximately every 2 s) rhythmic modulation of ventral root activity in which burst durations and intensities increased as cycle periods decreased. This pattern of activity was enhanced rather than abolished following blockade of glycine and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptors and presumably therefore resulted from a periodic increase in the excitation of motor neurons. To determine whether this slow rhythm resulted from intrinsic, 5-HT-dependent membrane potential oscillations, larvae were spinalized to prevent the release of 5-HT from brainstem raphe neurons. The resulting pattern of NMDA-induced activity lacked any slow modulation. The slow modulation could also be enhanced by the bath application of a 5-HT receptor agonist (5-carboxamidotryptamine) and abolished either by the addition of an antagonist (pindobind-5-HT1A) or by removal of magnesium ions, providing more direct evidence for a contribution of intrinsic oscillations. Thus, the 5-HT-dependent intrinsic oscillations modulate NMDA-induced swimming activity over several consecutive cycles.},

Understanding microbial interactions is a prerequisite for numerous goals in microbiome research; predicting how populations change over time, determining how manipulations of microbiomes affect dynamics, and designing synthetic microbiomes to perform tasks are just a few examples. As such, there is great interest in adapting population dynamic theory for microbial systems. Despite the appeal, numerous hurdles exist. One hurdle is that the data commonly obtained from DNA sequencing yield estimates of relative abundances, while population dynamic models such as the generalized Lotka-Volterra model track absolute abundances or densities. It is not clear whether relative abundance data alone can be used to infer parameters of population dynamic models such as the Lotka-Volterra model. Results We used structural identifiability analyses to determine the extent to which time series of relative abundances can be used to parameterize the generalized Lotka-Volterra model. We found that only with absolute abundance data to accompany relative abundance estimates from sequencing can all parameters be uniquely identified. However, relative abundance data alone do contain information on relative interaction strengths, which is sufficient for many studies where the goal is to estimate key interactions and their effects on dynamics. Our results also indicate that the relative interaction rates that can be estimated using relative abundance data provide ample information to estimate relative changes of absolute abundance over time. Using synthetic data for which we know the underlying structure, we found our results to be robust to modest amounts of both process and measurement error. Conclusions Fitting the generalized Lotka-Volterra model to time-series sequencing data typically requires either assuming a constant population size or performing additional measurements to obtain absolute abundances. We have found that these assumptions are not strictly necessary because relative abundance data alone contain sufficient information to estimate relative rates of interaction, and thus to infer key drivers of microbial population dynamics.},

  abstract = {Developmentally regulated action potentials are a hallmark of Rohon- Beard cells, a class of sensory neurons. In these neurons as well as other primary spinal neurons of Xenopus laevis, the functional differentiation of delayed-rectifier potassium current regulates the waveform of the action potential during the initial day of its appearance. Later, the acquisition of another voltage-dependent potassium current–the A current–plays a major role in regulating excitability. In order to understand the molecular basis of this functional differentiation, genes encoding voltage-dependent potassium currents expressed in the embryonic amphibian nervous system are being cloned. Here, we report the functional properties and developmental localization of a second Xenopus Shaker-like gene (Xenopus Kv 1.1; XSha1; GenBank accession number M94258) encoding a potassium current. Homology screening with the mouse gene MBK1 led to its isolation. Functional expression in oocytes identifies it as a delayed-rectifier current when assembled as a homooligomeric structure. Specific transcripts corresponding to XSha1 and to the previously cloned gene XSha2 are both detectable by RNase protection in RNA isolated from the embryonic nervous system. However, whole-mount in situ hybridization reveals the temporal pattern and cellular localization of XSha1 but not XSha2 mRNA, suggesting that the concentration of XSha2 transcripts in individual cells is lower than the threshold for detection by this method. Of particular interest, Rohon-Beard cells express XSha1 mRNA. In addition, XSha1 mRNA is detected in several structures containing neural crest derivatives including spinal ganglia, the trigeminal ganglion, and branchial arches; its presence in motor nerves and lateral spinal tracts suggests that both CNS and PNS glia express the mRNA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Measures of white matter microstructure are known to correlate cross-sectionally with cognitive ability measures, but only a few small studies have tested for longitudinal relations among these variables. We tested whether there were coupled changes in brain white matter microstructure indexed by fractional anisotropy (FA) and three broad cognitive domains (fluid intelligence, processing speed, and memory) in a large cohort of human participants with longitudinal diffusion tensor MRI and detailed cognitive data taken at ages 73 years (n = 731) and 76 years (n = 488). Longitudinal changes in white matter microstructure were coupled with changes in fluid intelligence, but not with processing speed or memory. Individuals with higher baseline white matter FA showed less subsequent decline in processing speed. Our results provide evidence for a longitudinal link between changes in white matter microstructure and aging-related cognitive decline during the eighth decade of life. They are consistent with theoretical perspectives positing that a corticocortical “disconnection” partly explains cognitive aging.},

  abstract = {Lateral bending of the trunk during terrestrial, quadrupedal locomotion was analyzed in four species of lizards, using high-speed videography and computerized motion analysis. The focus of the analysis was whether lizards produce a standing or a traveling wave of bending in the trunk during locomotion. Lizards with well-developed limbs (Cnemidophorus tigris and Dipsosaurus dorsalis) exhibit a standing wave of lateral bending at low speeds, which is replaced by a traveling wave of bending as velocity increases. Lizards with diminutive limbs (Gerrhonotus kingii and Eumeces multivirgatus) exhibit a traveling wave of lateral bending, even at the lowest speeds recorded. These results are not consistent with the ideas that lizards produce a standing wave of lateral bending during locomotion or that amniote vertebrates have lost the ability to produce a traveling wave of lateral flexion due to a change in the central pattern generator that controls locomotion.},

  abstract = {Embryos spinalized at the 3rd to 6th postotic myotome and immobilized in 10(-4) M tubocurarine can respond to a brief skin stimulus with motor root activity suitable for swimming. Embryos spinalized at the more caudal levels give shorter episodes of fictive swimming. We have previously described the synaptic inputs to motoneurons during fictive swimming in intact embryos (23). In the present paper we look to see if similar synaptic inputs are present in spinal embryos and are therefore spinal in origin. All motoneuron firing during fictive swimming is associated with a tonic depolarization that falls away slowly once firing stops, is increased by hyperpolarizing current, and is reduced by depolarizing current. A slow depolarizing potential evoked by lower levels of skin stimulation has similar properties and rate of fall. In 1-2 mM PDA, an excitatory amino acid antagonist, only a small remnant of the depolarization remains, and motoneuron firing stops. The NMDA antagonist 50 microM APV reduces the depolarization less but also blocks firing. Motoneurons fire one spike per swimming cycle, in phase with nearby motor root discharge. Spikes are preceded by a depolarizing prepotential. This increases with hyperpolarizing current, which can block the spike to reveal an underlying depolarizing potential. In phase with motor root discharge on the opposite side of the body, motoneurons receive a midcycle inhibitory postsynaptic potential, which increases with depolarizing current, decreases with hyperpolarizing current, and is blocked by 10(-6) M strychnine. Strychnine, 5 X 10(-7) M, leads first to broadening of motor root bursts then to loss of the alternating swimming pattern of activity, which is replaced by synchronous bursts on both sides of the body. We conclude that the synaptic inputs to motoneurons during fictive swimming in spinal embryos are very similar in properties and pharmacology to those in intact embryos. These inputs, including the tonic depolarization always associated with motoneuron firing during swimming, must be at least partly spinal in origin.},

The use of neuroanatomical and electrophysiological techniques to discover what nerve cells are present in the spinal cord is described and how they interact to generate swimming behaviour is explored. We now have a working hypothesis for spinal cord network operation which is being tested using computer simulations and which suggests general principles on how nervous systems may work.

  abstract = {Adult nervous systems are so complex that understanding how they produce behavior remains a real challenge. We chose to study hatchling Xenopus tadpoles where behavior is controlled by a few thousand neurons but there is a very limited number of types of neuron. Young tadpoles can flex, swim away, adjust their trajectory, speed-up and slow-down, stop when they contact support and struggle when grasped. They are sensitive to touch, pressure, noxious stimuli, light intensity and water currents. Using whole-cell recording has led to rapid progress in understanding central networks controlling behavior. Our methods are illustrated by an analysis of the flexion reflex to skin touch. We then define the seven types of neuron that allow the tadpole to swim when the skin is touched and use paired recordings to investigate neuron properties, synaptic connections and activity patterns. Proposals on how the swim network operates are evaluated by experiment and network modeling. We then examine GABAergic inhibitory pathways that control swimming but also produce tonic inhibition to reduce responsiveness when the tadpole is at rest. Finally, we analyze the strong alternating struggling movements the tadpole makes when grasped. We show that the mechanisms for rhythm generation here are very different to those during swimming. Although much remains to be explained, study of this simple vertebrate has uncovered basic principles about the function and organization of vertebrate nervous systems.},

Fundamental to understanding any full-scale neuronal network is knowledge of the constituent neurons, their properties, synaptic interconnections, and normal activity. Our novel strategy uses basic developmental rules to generate model networks that retain individual neuron and synapse resolution and are capable of reproducing correct, whole animal responses. We apply our developmental strategy to young Xenopus tadpoles, whose brainstem and spinal cord share a core vertebrate plan, but at a tractable complexity. Following detailed anatomical and physiological measurements to complete a descriptive library of each type of spinal neuron, we build models of their axon growth controlled by simple chemical gradients and physical barriers. By adding dendrites and allowing probabilistic formation of synaptic connections, we reconstruct network connectivity among up to 2000 neurons. When the resulting "network" is populated by model neurons and synapses, with properties based on physiology, it can respond to sensory stimulation by mimicking tadpole swimming behavior. This functioning model represents the most complete reconstruction of a vertebrate neuronal network that can reproduce the complex, rhythmic behavior of a whole animal. The findings validate our novel developmental strategy for generating realistic networks with individual neuron- and synapse-level resolution. We use it to demonstrate how early functional neuronal connectivity and behavior may in life result from simple developmental "rules," which lay out a scaffold for the vertebrate CNS without specific neuron-to-neuron recognition.},

These deficits appear on a background of reduced fluid intelligence, best measured with tests of novel problem solving. For a range of specific executive tests, we ask how far frontal deficits can be explained by a general fluid intelligence loss. For some widely used tests, e.g. Wisconsin Card Sorting, we find that fluid intelligence entirely explains frontal deficits. When patients and controls are matched on fluid intelligence, no further frontal deficit remains. For these tasks too, deficits are unrelated to lesion location within the frontal lobe. A second group of tasks, including tests of both cognitive (e.g. Hotel, Proverbs) and social (Faux Pas) function, shows a different pattern. Deficits are not fully explained by fluid intelligence and the data suggest association with lesions in the right anterior frontal cortex. Understanding of frontal lobe deficits may be clarified by separating reduced fluid intelligence, important in most or all tasks, from other more specific impairments and their associated regions of damage.},

Delay equations have an infinite-dimensional state space because their solution is unique only when an initial function is specified on a time interval of length equal to the largest delay. Consequently, analytical calculations are more difficult than for ordinary differential equations and numerical methods are generally the only way to achieve a complete analysis, prediction and control of systems with time delays. Delay differential equations are a special type of functional differential equation (FDE). In FDEs the time evolution of the state variable can depend on the past in an arbitrary way as long as the dependence is a bounded function of the past. However, DDEs impose a constraint on this dependence, namely that the evolution depends only on certain past values of the state at discrete times. (We do not consider here the case of distributed delay.) The delays can be constant or state dependent. The equations can also involve delayed values of the derivative of the state, which leads to equations of neutral type.},

Their activity patterns depend on the tuning of their intrinsic ionic conductances, their synaptic interconnectivity and entrainment by extrinsic neurons. The influence of two commonly found synaptic connectivities – reciprocal inhibition and electrical coupling – are investigated here using a neuron model with subthreshold oscillation capability, in different firing and entrainment regimes. We study the dynamics displayed by a network of a pair of neurons with various firing regimes, coupled by either (i) only reciprocal inhibition or by (ii) electrical coupling first and then reciprocal inhibition. In both scenarios a range of coupling strengths for the reciprocal inhibition is tested, and in general the neuron with the lower firing rate stops spiking for strong enough inhibitory coupling, while the faster neuron remains active. However, in scenario (ii) the originally slower neuron stops spiking at weaker inhibitory coupling strength, suggesting that the electrical coupling introduces an element of instability to the two-neuron network.},

Here we show that two nonbursty cells can be induced to burst in synchrony by mutual excitatory synaptic connections, provided the presynaptic threshold for graded synaptic transmission ateach synapse is at a different level. This mechanism may operate in a recently discovered network in the lobster Homarus gammarus.By a duality between presynaptic threshold and injected current, we also show that two identical, nonbursty, mutual excitatory cells could be induced to burst in synchrony by injecting differing amounts of current inthe two cells. Finally we show that differential oscillations betweentwo mutual excitatory cells could be stopped by a slow-tailedhyperpolarizing current pulse into one cell or a slow-taileddepolarizing pulse into the other.},

We begin by discussing models for single cells which display bursting oscillations. There are, in fact, several different classes of bursting solutions; these have been classified by the geometric properties of how solutions evolve in phase space. We describe several of the bursting classes and then review related rigorous mathematical analysis. We then discuss the dynamics of small networks of neurons. We are primarily interested in whether excitatory or inhibitory synaptic coupling leads to either synchronous or desynchronous rhythms. We demonstrate that all four combinations are possible, depending on the details of the intrinsic and synaptic properties of the cells. Finally, we discuss larger networks of neuronal oscillators involving two distinct cell populations. In particular, we demonstrate how dynamical systems methods can be used to analyze recent models for sleep rhythms and other oscillations generated in the thalamus. The analysis helps to explain the generation of the different thalamic rhythms and the transitions between them, in both of which inhibition plays a crucial role.},

This phenomenon can arise when the individual cells are conditional relaxation oscillators, in that they can be tuned to engage in relaxation oscillations, or when they are conditional square-wave bursters. The mechanism is illustrated with a model for conditional pacemaker neurons in the pre-Bötzinger complex as well as with a reduced form of this model. In the relaxation oscillator case, a periodic bursting solution is proved to exist in the singular limit, under a pair of general conditions. These conditions relate the durations of the silent and active phases of the bursting solution to the locations of certain structures in the phase plane, at appropriate synaptic input strengths. Further, additional conditions on the relative flow rates in the silent and active phases are proved to imply the uniqueness and asymptotic stability of the bursting solution.},

  abstract = {We develop a new computationally efficient approach for the analysis of complex large-scale neurobiological networks. Its key element is the use of a new phenomenological model of a neuron capable of replicating important spike pattern characteristics and designed in the form of a system of difference equations (a map). We developed a set of map-based models that replicate spiking activity of cortical fast spiking, regular spiking and intrinsically bursting neurons. Interconnected with synaptic currents these model neurons demonstrated responses very similar to those found with Hodgkin-Huxley models and in experiments. We illustrate the efficacy of this approach in simulations of one- and two-dimensional cortical network models consisting of regular spiking neurons and fast spiking interneurons to model sleep and activated states of the thalamocortical system. Our study suggests that map-based models can be widely used for large-scale simulations and that such models are especially useful for tasks where the modeling of specific firing patterns of different cell classes is important.},

  abstract = {The mammalian spinal cord contains a locomotor central pattern generator (CPG) that can produce alternating rhythmic activity of flexor and extensor motoneurones in the absence of rhythmic input and proprioceptive feedback. During such fictive locomotor activity in decerebrate cats, spontaneous omissions of activity occur simultaneously in multiple agonist motoneurone pools for a number of cycles. During these `deletions', antagonist motoneurone pools usually become tonically active but may also continue to be rhythmic. The rhythmic activity that re-emerges following a deletion is often not phase shifted. This suggests that some neuronal mechanism can maintain the locomotor period when motoneurone activity fails. To account for these observations, a simplified computational model of the spinal circuitry has been developed in which the locomotor CPG consists of two levels: a half-centre rhythm generator (RG) and a pattern formation (PF) network, with reciprocal inhibitory interactions between antagonist neural populations at each level. The model represents a network of interacting neural populations with single interneurones and motoneurones described in the Hodgkin-Huxley style. The model reproduces the range of locomotor periods and phase durations observed during real locomotion in adult cats and permits independent control of the level of motoneurone activity and of step cycle timing. By altering the excitability of neural populations within the PF network, the model can reproduce deletions in which motoneurone activity fails but the phase of locomotor oscillations is maintained. The model also suggests criteria for the functional identification of spinal interneurones involved in the mammalian locomotor pattern generation.},

  abstract = {The study of the magnitude and variation of drug response is defined as pharmacodynamics (PDs). PD models examine plasma concentration and effect relationship. It can predict the archetypal effect (E) of a drug as a function of the drug concentration (C) and estimate an unknown PD parameter (θpd). The PD models have been described as fixed, linear, log-linear, Emax, sigmoid Emax, and indirect PD response. Ligand binding model is an example of a PD model that works on the underpinning PD principle of a drug, eliciting its pharmacological effect at the receptor site. The pharmacological effect is produced by the drug binding to the receptor to either activate or antagonise the receptor. Ligand binding models describe a system of interacting components, i.e. the interaction of one or more ligands with one or more binding sites. The Emax model is the central method that provides an empirical justification for the concentration/dose-effect relationship. However, for ligand binding models justification is provided by theory of receptor occupancy. In essence, for ligand binding models, the term fractionaloccupancy is best used to describe the fraction of receptors occupied at a particular ligand concentration. It is stated that the fractionaloccupancy=occupiedbindingsites/totalbindingsites, which means the effect of a drug should depend on the fraction of receptors that are occupied. In the future, network-based systems pharmacology models using ligand binding principles could be an effective way of understanding drug-related adverse effects. This will facilitate and strengthen the development of rational drug therapy in clinical practice.},

The principles of MR are based on Mendel’s laws of inheritance and instrumental variable estimation methods, which enable the inference of causal effects in the presence of unobserved confounding. In this Primer, we outline the principles of MR, the instrumental variable conditions underlying MR estimation and some of the methods used for estimation. We go on to discuss how the assumptions underlying an MR study can be assessed and describe methods of estimation that are robust to certain violations of these assumptions. We give examples of a range of studies in which MR has been applied, the limitations of current methods of analysis and the outlook for MR in the future. The differences between the assumptions required for MR analysis and other forms of epidemiological studies means that MR can be used as part of a triangulation across multiple sources of evidence for causal inference.},

In the present study we investigate the question whether varying demands on central executive processes are reflected by differences in coherent activity between and within a fronto-parietal network. We calculated coherence during a visuospatial working memory task. Under an easy executive condition subjects had to mentally imagine previously studied abstract patterns, whereas in the difficult condition, subjects had to mentally manipulate these patterns. The results indicate the involvement of prefrontal areas in executive functions reflected by a decrease of anterior upper alpha short-range connectivity and a parallel increase of fronto-parietal long-range coherence mirroring activation of a fronto-parietal network.},

Local frontal-midline theta activity was associated with the general level of cognitive demand, with the highest amplitudes in the most demanding condition. Using low-resolution electromagnetic tomography analysis (LORETA), this theta activity was localized in the anterior cingulate gyrus including the cingulate motor area. These results suggest that local theta activity in the anterior cingulate gyrus represents correlates of an attentional system that allocate cognitive resources. In addition, interregional connectivity in the theta frequency range was modulated by memory-related executive functions independently of task difficulty. Connectivity analyses revealed a more distributed long-range network including frontal and parietal cortices during execution of novel compared with well-trained finger movement sequences. Thus, these results are compatible with a model in which theta long-range coupling indicates integration of sensory information into executive control components of complex motor behaviour.},

From the blood immunome of 1,001 individuals aged 8–96 years, we developed a deep-learning method based on patterns of systemic age-related inflammation. The resulting inflammatory clock of aging (iAge) tracked with multimorbidity, immunosenescence, frailty and cardiovascular aging, and is also associated with exceptional longevity in centenarians. The strongest contributor to iAge was the chemokine CXCL9, which was involved in cardiac aging, adverse cardiac remodeling and poor vascular function. Furthermore, aging endothelial cells in human and mice show loss of function, cellular senescence and hallmark phenotypes of arterial stiffness, all of which are reversed by silencing CXCL9. In conclusion, we identify a key role of CXCL9 in age-related chronic inflammation and derive a metric for multimorbidity that can be utilized for the early detection of age-related clinical phenotypes.},

This paper reviews recent data showing that NMDA can induce similiar inherent membrane potential behavior in synaptically isolated motoneurons and interneurons in the mammalian (in vitro neonatal rat) spinal cord. These TTX-resistant voltage fluctuations include rhythmic oscillations and plateau potentials, as well as low-frequency long-lasting voltage shifts (LLVSs). 5-HT facilitates the transformation of LLVSs into oscillatory events, and 5-HT receptor antagonists have the reverse effect. In the absence of TTX, locomotor-related rhythmic drive potentials in spinal cord neurons can display nonlinear voltage behavior compatible with NMDA receptor activation, although other voltage-activated conductances are not excluded. Suppression of the nonlinear voltage response associated with NMDA receptor activation, via removal of Mg2+, disrupts locomotor patterns of network activity. The potential role of NMDA receptor activation in the operation of mammalian locomotor networks is discussed in the context of these recent observations.},

Mitral cells within a single odorant receptor-specific network can be synchronized by dendrodendritic excitatory interactions in a glomerulus, whereas mitral cells in different networks engage in long-lasting lateral inhibition mediated by dendrodendritic synapses with interneurons. The emerging picture is one in which groups of mitral cells use a unique set of mechanisms to accomplish computational functions similar to those performed by analogous modular structures in other sensory systems.},

The richness and evenness of the fecal microbiota significantly increased with age, and the abundance of 16 genera differed between the young and old groups. Additionally, 17 urine metabolites contributed to the differences between the young and old groups. Among the microbes that differed by age, Bacteroides and Prevotella 9 were confirmed to be correlated with some urine metabolites. The machine learning algorithm eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) was shown to produce the best performing age predictors, with a mean absolute error of 5.48 years. The accuracy of the model improved to 4.93 years with the inclusion of urine metabolite data. This study shows that the gut microbiota and urine metabolic profiles can be used to predict the age of healthy individuals with relatively good accuracy.},

This measurement error is a combination of systematic components, originating from the measuring instrument and random measurement errors. Several novel biological technologies, such as mass cytometry and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), are plagued with systematic errors that may severely affect statistical analysis if the data are not properly calibrated.We propose a novel deep learning approach for removing systematic batch effects. Our method is based on a residual neural network, trained to minimize the Maximum Mean Discrepancy between the multivariate distributions of two replicates, measured in different batches. We apply our method to mass cytometry and scRNA-seq datasets, and demonstrate that it effectively attenuates batch effects.our codes and data are publicly available at https://github.com/ushaham/BatchEffectRemoval.gitSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {Many applications in the biomedical domain involve the detailed molecular and functional characterization of macro-molecules such as proteins. Where possible, this involves the knowledge of detailed 3D coordinates of every atom within a protein. At the same time, machine learning has become the basis of much innovation within this domain in recent years. There are, however, a few challenges in applying machine learning to 3D protein structures, such as variability in size and high dimensionality of the data. It would therefore be beneficial to be able to map every protein structure to a smaller fixed-dimensional representation that is directly learned from the structure without manual curation. In addition, it would be valuable for biomedical researchers if such approaches would require little method development and instead draw from cutting-edge research such as image classification via deep neural networks. Here, such an approach is outlined that first re-formats protein structures as 2D color images and then applies off-the-shelf neural networks for image classification. It is shown that such neural networks can be trained to effectively encode the CATH protein classification database and that feature vectors extracted from such networks, once trained, can be transferred to a completely new task that is likely to benefit from molecular protein information, namely that of small molecule binding.},

  abstract = {The existence and possible contribution of intrinsic membrane potential oscillations to the generation of locomotor rhythmicity was investigated in spinal cord neurons of newly hatched Rana temporaria tadpoles, by intracellular recording from immobilized animals. The bath application of 100 \$\textbackslash mu \$M N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) evoked continuous swimming-like activity in ventral motor roots and rhythmic synaptic drive to ventrally located spinal neurons, presumed to be motorneurons. In 0.5 \$\textbackslash mu \$M tetrodotoxin-treated preparations, similar applications of NMDA depolarized neurons by ca. 20 mV, but did not lead to intrinsic oscillatory activity, although some evidence for voltage-dependent membrane bistability was obtained. However, bath application of the neuromodulatory amine, serotonin (5HT; 5 \$\textbackslash mu \$M), in the presence of NMDA and TTX, reversibly induced sustained membrane potential oscillations (up to 40 mV in amplitude) that were similar in waveform to those already described in other adult vertebrate motor systems. The TTX-resistant oscillations were dependent upon the presence of magnesium ions in the bathing solution and were abolished by the NMDA receptor antagonist, D-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV). The results suggest that in this simple, developing vertebrate locomotor system, the activation of 5HT receptors on spinal cord neurons in turn modulates NMDA receptor activation to enable the expression of intrinsic oscillatory membrane properties which could contribute to the generation of locomotor behaviour.},

We measured responses during both tonic and burst firing modes to sinusoidal current injection and performed Fourier analysis on these responses. For comparison, we constructed a minimal "integrate-and-fire-or-burst" (IFB) neuron model that reproduces salient features of the relay cell responses. The IFB model is constrained to quantitatively fit our Fourier analysis of experimental relay neuron responses, including: the temporal tuning of the response in both tonic and burst modes, including a finding of low-pass and sometimes broadband behavior of tonic firing and band-pass characteristics during bursting, and the generally greater linearity of tonic compared with burst responses at low frequencies. In tonic mode, both experimental and theoretical responses display a frequency-dependent transition from massively superharmonic spiking to phase-locked superharmonic spiking near 3 Hz, followed by phase-locked subharmonic spiking at higher frequencies. Subharmonic and superharmonic burst responses also were observed experimentally. Characterizing the response properties of the "tuned" IFB model leads to insights regarding the observed stimulus dependence of burst versus tonic response mode in relay neurons. Furthermore the simplicity of the IFB model makes it a candidate for large scale network simulations of thalamic functioning.},

Yet, the causal role of the gut microbiota during host aging is largely unexplored. Here, using the African turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri), a naturally short-lived vertebrate, we show that the gut microbiota plays a key role in modulating vertebrate life span. Recolonizing the gut of middle-age individuals with bacteria from young donors resulted in life span extension and delayed behavioral decline. This intervention prevented the decrease in microbial diversity associated with host aging and maintained a young-like gut bacterial community, characterized by overrepresentation of the key genera Exiguobacterium, Planococcus, Propionigenium and Psychrobacter. Our findings demonstrate that the natural microbial gut community of young individuals can causally induce long-lasting beneficial systemic effects that lead to life span extension in a vertebrate model.},

Resting potentials and input resistances of such neurons are -75 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 2 mV (mean \$\textbackslash pm\$ standard error) and 118 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 17 MΩ respectively. Most cells fire a single impulse, 0.5 to 2.0 ms in duration and 48.5 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 1.8 mV in amplitude, in response to a depolarizing current step. A minority fire several spikes of diminishing amplitude to more strongly depolarizing current. Cells held above spike, threshold fire on rebound from brief hyperpolarizing pulses. Spikes are blocked by 0.1 to 1.0 𝜇M tetrodotoxin (TTX) and are therefore Na+-dependent. Current/voltage (I/V) plots to injected current are approximately linear near the resting potential but become non-linear at more depolarized levels. Cells recorded in TTX with CsCl-filled microelectrodes show a linearized I/V plot at depolarized membrane potentials suggesting the normal presence of a voltage-dependent K+ conductance activated at relatively depolarized levels. Most cells recorded in this way but without TTX fire long trains of spikes of near constant amplitude, pointing to a role of the K+ conductance in limiting firing in normal cells. Spike blockage with TTX reveals, in some cells, a transient depolarizing Cd2+-sensitive and therefore presumably Ca2+-dependent potential that increases in amplitude with depolarization. Cells in TTX, Cd2+, and strychnine, and recorded with CsCl-filled microelectrodes to block active conductances respond to hyperpolarizing current steps with a two component exponential response. The cell time constant (τ0) obtained from the longer of these by exponential peeling is relatively long (mean 15.7 ms). These findings contribute to an increased understanding of the cellular properties involved in spinal rhythm generation in this simple vertebrate.},

  abstract = {Xenopus embryos show two distinct rhythmic motor patterns: swimming and struggling. Both can be generated by spinal cord circuitry and evoked by stimulation of a single skin sensory pathway (Soffe, 1991b). This presents a valuable opportunity to explore mechanisms for vertebrate motor pattern switching. Swimming and struggling have been compared using intracellular recording from spinal neurons in immobilized embryos. Underlying synaptic drive was similar; motoneurons and premotor interneurons were excited in phase with ipsilateral motor root discharge and inhibited in phase with contralateral motor root discharge. Excitation was stronger during struggling and associated with short bursts of impulses, contrasting with single spikes per cycle during swimming. Excitation was reduced in both patterns by local application of 1 mM kynurenic acid, indicating excitatory amino acid mediation. Inhibition was antagonized by 1 microM strychnine, indicating glycine mediation. Many motoneurons (76\%) and premotor interneurons (68\%) fired during both swimming and struggling, including examples of all three spinal premotor interneuron classes. Most of the remaining motoneurons (20\%) and premotor interneurons (24\%) fired only during struggling, providing roughly 30\% more active neurons than during swimming. To investigate whether new neuronal classes become active during struggling, recordings were made from sensory neurons and sensory interneurons. Rohon-Beard sensory neurons did not fire during either swimming or struggling. Dorsolateral commissural sensory interneurons received rhythmic, strychnine-sensitive inhibition during both swimming and struggling and also did not fire. Neither of these neuronal classes is therefore recruited to the circuitry for struggling. Although behaviorally distinct, Xenopus embryo swimming and struggling motor patterns appear to employ similar synaptic drive. I propose that this reflects the common nature of much of the premotor circuitry that drives them. Extra neurons are recruited to this circuitry during struggling, but only from within classes that also participate in swimming.},

  abstract = {1. Mechanisms underlying the selective expression of different motor patterns in vertebrates are poorly understood. Immobilized, spinal Xenopus embryos are used here to examine the motor patterns evoked by various concentrations of excitatory amino acids. 2. Relatively low concentrations of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) (40-60 microM), kainate (7-8 microM), and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) (5 microM) evoked motor root discharge characteristic of swimming. Brief applications of higher concentrations of kainate (20-40 microM), AMPA (25-30 microM), quisqualate (5 microM), and glutamate (1-4 mM) evoked sequences of a different motor pattern: struggling. This is characterized by a longer cycle period, increased burst duration, and a reversed longitudinal pattern of motor root discharge. The struggling pattern was never evoked by higher concentrations of NMDA (300-500 microM), but was evoked by 30 microM AMPA or 5 microM quisqualate in the presence of 50 microM D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid. 3. Intracellular recordings from presumed spinal motoneurons showed different patterns of activity during agonist-evoked swimming and struggling. The patterns were like those described previously during sensory-evoked behavior. 4. Caudal applications of excitatory amino acids that produced struggling discharge did so only at caudal motor roots, whereas caudal applications of NMDA evoked swimming activity throughout the spinal cord. 5. During excitatory-amino-acid-evoked struggling, sensory Rohon-Beard neurons depolarized up to 7 mV, but did not fire. 6. The results show that expression of the struggling pattern, like swimming, is not critically dependent on sensory discharge. The results are also consistent with the idea that expression of the two very different motor patterns for swimming or struggling in this simple vertebrate preparation can be controlled by the level of excitation within the spinal motor circuitry, and need not involve the activity of a specific external neuromodulator.},

  abstract = {Bursting behavior is one of the most important firing activities of neural system and plays an important role in signal encoding and transmission. In the present paper, a neural network with delay coupling is modeled to investigate the generation mechanism of bursting behavior. The Andronov-Hopf bifurcation is firstly studied and then the degenerated Andronov-Hopf bifurcation, namely Bautin bifurcation, is analyzed with the external input varying. Classifying dynamics in the neighborhood of the Bautin bifurcation, we obtain the bifurcation sets where the supercritical/subcritical Andronov-Hopf, or the fold limit cycle bifurcation may happen in the system under consideration. For a periodic disturbance occurring in the neighborhood of the Bautin bifurcation, it is seen that the Andronov-Hopf bifurcation and fold limit cycle bifurcation may lead to the transition from quiescent state to firing activities. Complex bursting phenomena, including Hopf/Hopf bursting, Hopf/Fold cycle bursting, SubHopf/Hopf bursting and SubHopf/Fold cycle bursting are found in the firing area. The results show that the dynamical properties of different burstings are related to the dynamical behaviors derived from the bifurcations of the system. Finally, it is seen that the bursting disappears but the periodic spiking appears in the delayed neural network for large values of delay.},

Neuronal model reduction methods provide a means to reduce model complexity while retaining the original model's realism and relevance. Such methods, however, typically include ad hoc components that require that the modeler already be intimately familiar with the dynamics of the original model. We present an automated, algorithmic method for reducing conductance-based neuron models using the method of equivalent potentials (Kelper et al., Biol Cybern 66(5):381–387, 1992) Our results demonstrate that this algorithm is able to reduce the complexity of the original model with minimal performance loss, and requires minimal prior knowledge of the model's dynamics. Furthermore, by utilizing a cost function based on the contribution of each state variable to the total conductance of the model, the performance of the algorithm can be significantly improved.},

An outstanding question is how cells regulate their internal driving forces to maintain tissue cohesiveness while promoting the requisite fluidity for collective motion. Progress has been limited by the lack of an integrative framework that couples cellular physical behavior with stochastic biochemical dynamics underlying cell motion and adhesion. Here we develop a cell-based computational model for collective cell migration during epithelial wound repair that integrates tissue mechanics with active cell motility, cell-substrate adhesions, and actomyosin dynamics. Using this model we show that an optimum balance of protrusive cell crawling and actomyosin contractility drives rapid directed motion of cohesive cell groups, robust to variations in cell and substrate physical properties. We further show that disparate modes of individual cell migration can cooperate to accelerate collective cell migration by fluidizing confluent tissues.},

  abstract = {The intestinal microbiota is a microbial ecosystem of crucial importance to human health. Understanding how the microbiota confers resistance against enteric pathogens and how antibiotics disrupt that resistance is key to the prevention and cure of intestinal infections. We present a novel method to infer microbial community ecology directly from time-resolved metagenomics. This method extends generalized Lotka–Volterra dynamics to account for external perturbations. Data from recent experiments on antibiotic-mediated Clostridium difficile infection is analyzed to quantify microbial interactions, commensal-pathogen interactions, and the effect of the antibiotic on the community. Stability analysis reveals that the microbiota is intrinsically stable, explaining how antibiotic perturbations and C. difficile inoculation can produce catastrophic shifts that persist even after removal of the perturbations. Importantly, the analysis suggests a subnetwork of bacterial groups implicated in protection against C. difficile. Due to its generality, our method can be applied to any high-resolution ecological time-series data to infer community structure and response to external stimuli.},

  abstract = {The presence of subgroups in vomeronasal sensory neurons has been known in various animals. To elucidate possible functional subdivisions in the guinea-pig accessory olfactory bulb, the combined studies with GTP-binding protein immunohistochemistry, electrophysiological and optical recordings were carried out. Gi2 alpha and Go alpha proteins were immunohistochemically localized, respectively, in the anterior and posterior regions of the vomeronasal nerve and glomerular layers, indicating that the guinea-pig accessory olfactory bulb receives at least two different inputs. This suggests that an anatomical boundary exists in these two layers. A mapping study of field potentials in sagittal slice preparations demonstrated that stimulation of the anterior vomeronasal nerve layer elicited field potentials with weak oscillatory responses exclusively in the anterior region of the external plexiform layer, whereas shocks to the posterior vomeronasal nerve layer provoked distinct oscillatory responses within the posterior one. The damping factors of oscillations in the anterior and posterior regions were 0.064+/-0.028 and 0.025+/-0.014, respectively. These electrophysiological results suggest that the accessory olfactory bulb consists of two functionally different subdivisions. Real-time optical imaging showed that anterior vomeronasal nerve layer shocks produced neural activity which spread horizontally from anterior to posterior only within the anterior region of the external plexiform and mitral cell layers, whereas shocks to the posterior vomeronasal nerve layer evoked periodic neural activity which spread horizontally from posterior to anterior only within the posterior region. Furthermore, the most posterior extent of the optical response evoked in the anterior region immediately adjoined the most anterior extent of that evoked in the posterior region. The maximal distance of signal propagation in the granule cell layer corresponded to that in the overlying external plexiform and mitral cell layers, indicating that the granule cell layer also has a similar boundary. Thus, these optical imaging studies not only demonstrated a precise boundary in each layer of the accessory olfactory bulb, which was positioned right beneath the boundary defined by GTP-binding protein immunohistochemistry, but also confirmed the observations from electrophysiological mapping that evoked field potentials are independently distributed in each of two subdivisions. The presence of the functional subdivision in each layer leads us to conclude that the accessory olfactory bulb in the guinea-pig is distinctly segregated into the anterior and posterior subdivisions, and to suggest that there are at least two different input output pathways in the vomeronasal system.},

  abstract = {Working memory is the limited capacity storage system involved in the maintenance and manipulation of information over short periods of time. Individual capacity of working memory is associated with the integrity of white matter in the frontoparietal regions. It is unknown to what extent the integrity of white matter underlying the working memory system is plastic. Using voxel-based analysis (VBA) of fractional anisotropy (FA) measures of fiber tracts, we investigated the effect of working memory training on structural connectivity in an interventional study. The amount of working memory training correlated with increased FA in the white matter regions adjacent to the intraparietal sulcus and the anterior part of the body of the corpus callosum after training. These results showed training-induced plasticity in regions that are thought to be critical in working memory. As changes in myelination lead to FA changes in diffusion tensor imaging, a possible mechanism for the observed FA change is increased myelination after training. Observed structural changes may underlie previously reported improvement of working memory capacity, improvement of other cognitive functions, and altered functional activity following working memory training.},

After filtering for contaminants, we identified 117 microbial species in blood, some of which had DNA signatures of microbial replication. They were primarily commensals associated with the gut (n\,=\,40), mouth (n\,=\,32) and genitourinary tract (n\,=\,18), and were distinct from pathogens detected in hospital blood cultures. No species were detected in 84\% of individuals, while the remainder only had a median of one species. Less than 5\% of individuals shared the same species, no co-occurrence patterns between different species were observed and no associations between host phenotypes and microbes were found. Overall, these results do not support the hypothesis of a consistent core microbiome endogenous to human blood. Rather, our findings support the transient and sporadic translocation of commensal microbes from other body sites into the bloodstream.},

  abstract = {It is crucial to determine the effects on the network level of a modulation of intrinsic membrane properties. The role calcium-dependent potassium channels, KCa, in the lamprey locomotor system has been investigated extensively. Earlier experimental studies have shown that apamin, which affects one type of KCa, increases the cycle duration of the locomotor network, due to effects on the burst termination. The effects of apamin were here larger when the network had a low level of activity (burst frequency 0.5 to 1 Hz) as compared to a higher rate ({$>$}2 Hz). By using a previously developed simulation model based on the lamprey locomotor network, we show that the model could account for the frequency dependence of the apamin modulation, if only the KCa conductance activated by Ca2+ entering during the action potential was altered and not the KCa conductance activated by Ca2+ entering through NMDA channels. The present simulation model of the spinal network in the lamprey can thus account for earlier experimental results with apamin on the network and cellular level that previously appeared enigmatic.},

  publisher = {{Dover Publications, Incorporated}},
  abstract = {This unusually well-written, skillfully organized introductory text provides an exhaustive survey of ordinary differential equations — equations which express the relationship between variables and their derivatives. In a disarmingly simple, step-by-step style that never sacrifices mathematical rigor, the authors — Morris Tenenbaum of Cornell University, and Harry Pollard of Purdue University — introduce and explain complex, critically-important concepts to undergraduate students of mathematics, engineering and the sciences. The book begins with a section that examines the origin of differential equations, defines basic terms and outlines the general solution of a differential equation-the solution that actually contains every solution of such an equation. Subsequent sections deal with such subjects as: integrating factors; dilution and accretion problems; the algebra of complex numbers; the linearization of first order systems; Laplace Transforms; Newton's Interpolation Formulas; and Picard's Method of Successive Approximations. The book contains two exceptional chapters: one on series methods of solving differential equations, the second on numerical methods of solving differential equations. The first includes a discussion of the Legendre Differential Equation, Legendre Functions, Legendre Polynomials, the Bessel Differential Equation, and the Laguerre Differential Equation. Throughout the book, every term is clearly defined and every theorem lucidly and thoroughly analyzed, and there is an admirable balance between the theory of differential equations and their application. An abundance of solved problems and practice exercises enhances the value of Ordinary Differential Equations as a classroom text for undergraduate students and teaching professionals. The book concludes with an in-depth examination of existence and uniqueness theorems about a variety of differential equations, as well as an introduction to the theory of determinants and theorems about Wronskians.},

The mathematical mechanism responsible for this dynamics is described. We prove that during the transition from bursting to continuous spiking the system must undergo a large number of bifurcations. After each bifurcation the system is increasingly chaotic in the sense that the maximal invariant set of a certain two-dimensional map is topologically equivalent to the shift on a larger set of symbols.

Computer simulations and analysis of this model illuminate the roles of the coupling architecture of the network, and associated synaptic conductances, in modulating the activity patterns displayed by this network. Depending on the relationships of these coupling parameters, the network can support three general classes of sustained firing patterns: clustering, propagating waves, and repetitive spiking that may show little regularity or correlation. Each activity pattern can occur continuously or in discrete episodes. We characterize the mechanisms underlying these rhythms, as well as the influence of parameters on details such as spiking frequency and wave speed. These results suggest that the subthalamopallidal circuit is capable both of correlated rhythmic activity and of irregular autonomous patterns of activity that block rhythmicity. Increased striatal input to, and weakened intrapallidal inhibition within, the indirect pathway can switch the behavior of the circuit from irregular to rhythmic. This may be sufficient to explain the emergence of correlated oscillatory activity in the subthalamopallidal circuit after destruction of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease and in animal models of parkinsonism.},

We introduce a one-dimensional map that captures the irregular activity occurring in our simulations of conductance-based differential equations and mathematically analyze the instability of fixed points corresponding to synchronous and antiphase spiking for this map. We find that the irregular solutions that arise exhibit expansion, contraction, and folding in phase space, as expected in chaotic dynamics. Our analysis shows that these features are produced from the interplay of synaptic inhibition with sodium, potassium, and leak currents in a conductance-based framework and provides precise conditions on parameters that ensure that irregular activity will occur. In particular, the temporal details of spiking dynamics must be present for a model to exhibit this irregularity mechanism and must be considered analytically to capture these effects.},

  abstract = {Background: How specific are the synaptic connections formed as neuronal networks develop and can simple rules account for the formation of functioning circuits? These questions are assessed in the spinal circuits controlling swimming in hatchling frog tadpoles. This is possible because detailed information is now available on the identity and synaptic connections of the main types of neuron. Results: The probabilities of synapses between 7 types of identified spinal neuron were measured directly by making electrical recordings from 500 pairs of neurons. For the same neuron types, the dorso-ventral distributions of axons and dendrites were measured and then used to calculate the probabilities that axons would encounter particular dendrites and so potentially form synaptic connections. Surprisingly, synapses were found between all types of neuron but contact probabilities could be predicted simply by the anatomical overlap of their axons and dendrites. These results suggested that synapse formation may not require axons to recognise specific, correct dendrites. To test the plausibility of simpler hypotheses, we first made computational models that were able to generate longitudinal axon growth paths and reproduce the axon distribution patterns and synaptic contact probabilities found in the spinal cord. To test if probabilistic rules could produce functioning spinal networks, we then made realistic computational models of spinal cord neurons, giving them established cell-specific properties and connecting them into networks using the contact probabilities we had determined. A majority of these networks produced robust swimming activity. Conclusion: Simple factors such as morphogen gradients controlling dorso-ventral soma, dendrite and axon positions may sufficiently constrain the synaptic connections made between different types of neuron as the spinal cord first develops and allow functional networks to form. Our analysis implies that detailed cellular recognition between spinal neuron types may not be necessary for the reliable formation of functional networks to generate early behaviour like swimming.},

  abstract = {Epithelial tissues are inevitably damaged from time to time and must therefore have robust repair mechanisms. The behaviour of tissues depends on their mechanical properties and those of the surrounding environment. However, it remains poorly understood how tissue mechanics regulates wound healing, particularly in in vivo animal tissues. Here we show that by tuning epithelial cell junctional tension, we can alter the rate of wound healing. We observe cells moving past each other at the wound edge by intercalating, like molecules in a fluid, resulting in seamless wound closure. Using a computational model, we counterintuitively predict that an increase in tissue fluidity, via a reduction in junctional tension, can accelerate the rate of wound healing. This is contrary to previous evidence that actomyosin tensile structures are important for wound closure. When we experimentally reduce tissue tension, cells intercalate faster and wounds close in less time. The role we describe for tissue fluidity in wound healing, in addition to its known roles in developing and mature tissues, reinforces the importance of the fluid state of a tissue.},

The axon initial segment, the proposed site of action potential generation, usually emanates directly from the soma. However, we found that axons of hippocampal pyramidal cells frequently derive from a basal dendrite rather than from the soma. This morphology is particularly enriched in central CA1, the principal hippocampal output area. Multiphoton glutamate uncaging revealed that input onto the axon-carrying dendrites (AcDs) was more efficient in eliciting action potential output than input onto regular basal dendrites. First, synaptic input onto AcDs generates action potentials with lower activation thresholds compared with regular dendrites. Second, AcDs are intrinsically more excitable, generating dendritic spikes with higher probability and greater strength. Thus, axon-carrying dendrites constitute a privileged channel for excitatory synaptic input in a subset of cortical pyramidal cells. Video Abstract},

  abstract = {Based on a detailed morphology “Full Model” of a leech heart interneuron, we previously developed a computationally efficient, morphologically inspired “Reduced Model” to expedite tuning the model to produce endogenous bursting and alternating bursting when configured as a half-center oscillator (paired with reciprocally inhibitory synapses). To find conductance density distributions that produce endogenous bursting, we implemented a genetic algorithm automated parameter search. With multiple searches, we found eight parameter sets that produced endogenous bursting in the Reduced Model. When these parameter sets were applied to the Full Model, all produced endogenous bursting, although when the simulation time was extended from 80 to 300 s, only four parameter sets produced sustained bursting in the Reduced Models. All parameter sets produced alternating half-center bursting in the Reduced and Full Models throughout the entire 300 s. When conductance amplitudes were systematically varied for each of the four sustained burster sets, the effects on bursting activity differed, both for the same parameter set in the Reduced and Full Models and for different parameter sets with the same level of morphological detail. This implies that morphological detail can affect burst activity and that these parameter sets may represent different mechanisms for burst generation and/or regulation. We also tested the models with parameter variations that correspond to experimental manipulations. We conclude that, whereas similar output can be achieved with multiple different parameter sets, perturbations such as conductance variations can highlight differences. Additionally, this work demonstrates both the utility and limitations of using simplified models to represent more morphologically accurate models.},

  abstract = {Neurons in vitro and in vivo have epochs of bursting or “up state” activity during which firing rates are dramatically elevated. Various methods of detecting bursts in extracellular spike trains have appeared in the literature, the most widely used apparently being Poisson Surprise (PS). A natural description of the phenomenon assumes (1) there are two hidden states, which we label “burst” and “non-burst,” (2) the neuron evolves stochastically, switching at random between these two states, and (3) within each state the spike train follows a time-homogeneous point process. If in (2) the transitions from non-burst to burst and burst to non-burst states are memoryless, this becomes a hidden Markov model (HMM). For HMMs, the state transitions follow exponential distributions, and are highly irregular. Because observed bursting may in some cases be fairly regular—exhibiting inter-burst intervals with small variation—we relaxed this assumption. When more general probability distributions are used to describe the state transitions the two-state point process model becomes a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM). We developed an efficient Bayesian computational scheme to fit HSMMs to spike train data. Numerical simulations indicate the method can perform well, sometimes yielding very different results than those based on PS.},

  abstract = {Only few studies document longer periods of fasting in large cohorts including non-obese participants. The aim of this study was to document prospectively the safety and any changes in basic health and well-being indicators during Buchinger periodic fasting within a specialised clinic. In a one-year observational study 1422 subjects participated in a fasting program consisting of fasting periods of between 4 and 21 days. Subjects were grouped in fasting period lengths of 5, 10, 15 and 20±2 days. The participants fasted according to the Buchinger guidelines with a daily caloric intake of 200–250 kcal accompanied by a moderate-intensity lifestyle program. Clinical parameters as well as adverse effects and well-being were documented daily. Blood examinations before and at the end of the fasting period complemented the pre-post analysis using mixed-effects linear models. Significant reductions in weight, abdominal circumference and blood pressure were observed in the whole group (each p{$<$}0.001). A beneficial modulating effect of fasting on blood lipids, glucoregulation and further general health-related blood parameters was shown. In all groups, fasting led to a decrease in blood glucose levels to low norm range and to an increase in ketone bodies levels (each p{$<$}0.001), documenting the metabolic switch. An increase in physical and emotional well-being (each p{$<$}0.001) and an absence of hunger feeling in 93.2\% of the subjects supported the feasibility of prolonged fasting. Among the 404 subjects with pre-existing health-complaints, 341 (84.4\%) reported an improvement. Adverse effects were reported in less than 1\% of the participants. The results from 1422 subjects showed for the first time that Buchinger periodic fasting lasting from 4 to 21 days is safe and well tolerated. It led to enhancement of emotional and physical well-being and improvements in relevant cardiovascular and general risk factors, as well as subjective health complaints.},

  abstract = {Epigenetic clocks are age predictors that use machine-learning models trained on DNA CpG methylation values to predict chronological or biological age. Increases in predicted epigenetic age relative to chronological age (epigenetic age acceleration) are connected to aging-associated pathologies, and changes in epigenetic age are linked to canonical aging hallmarks. However, epigenetic clocks rely on training data from bulk tissues whose cellular composition changes with age. We found that human naive CD8+ T cells, which decrease during aging, exhibit an epigenetic age 15–20 years younger than effector memory CD8+ T cells from the same individual. Importantly, homogenous naive T cells isolated from individuals of different ages show a progressive increase in epigenetic age, indicating that current epigenetic clocks measure two independent variables, aging and immune cell composition. To isolate the age-associated cell intrinsic changes, we created a new clock, the IntrinClock, that did not change among 10 immune cell types tested. IntrinClock showed a robust predicted epigenetic age increase in a model of replicative senescence in vitro and age reversal during OSKM-mediated reprogramming.},

However, bulk RNA-seq continues to be the main workhorse for quantifying gene expression levels due to technical simplicity and low cost. To most effectively extract information from bulk data given the new knowledge gained from single-cell methods, we have developed a novel algorithm to estimate the cell-type composition of bulk data from a single-cell RNA-seq-derived cell-type signature. Comparison with existing methods using various real RNA-seq data sets indicates that our new approach is more accurate and comprehensive than previous methods, especially for the estimation of rare cell types. More importantly, our method can detect cell-type composition changes in response to external perturbations, thereby providing a valuable, cost-effective method for dissecting the cell-type-specific effects of drug treatments or condition changes. As such, our method is applicable to a wide range of biological and clinical investigations., Bulk RNA-seq data harbors valuable information about gene expression levels from different cell types in tissue samples. Here, the authors develop DWLS, a computational method for estimating cell-type composition of bulk data by leveraging single-cell RNA-seq-derived cell-type signatures.},

A sequence of action potentials (spike train) often has high frequency spike episodes that are generally called bursts. However, bursts are difficult to quantify and require operational definitions that reflect the type of activity and the interest of the experimenter. This paper presents a simple method for defining bursts as strings of spikes with only two parameters: a minimum number of spikes per burst and a maximum interspike interval. These two values represent a simple parameterization that is adequate for the description of temporal grouping in spike trains. Because this method has a minimal computation time, it allows implementation of burst analysis in real-time, including statistical changes in burst variables, histograms of burst types, and patterns in combinations of burst variables.},

However, the extent to which interpersonal relations shape the individual genetic makeup of the microbiome and its transmission within and across populations remains largely unknown3,4. Here, capitalizing on more than 9,700 human metagenomes and computational strain-level profiling, we detected extensive bacterial strain sharing across individuals (more than 10 million instances) with distinct mother-to-infant, intra-household and intra-population transmission patterns. Mother-to-infant gut microbiome transmission was considerable and stable during infancy (around 50\% of the same strains among shared species (strain-sharing rate)) and remained detectable at older ages. By contrast, the transmission of the oral microbiome occurred largely horizontally and was enhanced by the duration of cohabitation. There was substantial strain sharing among cohabiting individuals, with 12\% and 32\% median strain-sharing rates for the gut and oral microbiomes, and time since cohabitation affected strain sharing more than age or genetics~did. Bacterial strain sharing additionally recapitulated host population structures better than species-level profiles~did. Finally, distinct taxa appeared as efficient spreaders across transmission modes and were associated with different predicted bacterial phenotypes linked with out-of-host survival capabilities. The extent of microorganism transmission that we describe underscores its relevance in human microbiome studies5, especially those on non-infectious, microbiome-associated diseases.},

  abstract = {1. Acutely isolated Xenopus spinal neurons possess a slowly activating Ca(2+)-dependent outward current which was revealed either by removal of external Ca2+ or by the addition of the Ca2+ channel blocker, 150 microM Cd2+. 2. The Ca(2+)-sensitive current was very slow to activate and had a mean time constant of activation of 437 ms at 0 mV. The current also had very long tail currents which were blocked by Cd2+. The rate of decay of the slowest component of the Ca(2+)-dependent tail currents was insensitive to membrane potential suggesting that the relaxation of the Ca(2+)-dependent current may only be weakly voltage dependent. 3. The reversal potential of the Ca(2+)-sensitive tail currents depended on the concentration of external K+ in a manner predicted by the Nernst equation. Thus the Ca(2+)-sensitive current was carried by K+. 4. The toxin apamin (10 nM to 2 microM) selectively blocked the Ca(2+)-dependent K+ current without affecting voltage-gated K+ currents. This current may be analogous to a small-conductance Ca(2+)-dependent K+ (SK) current; however, unlike some SK currents, the Ca(2+)-dependent K+ current was also sensitive to 500 microM tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA). 5. Applications of 10 nM apamin to spinalized embryos did not perturb the motor pattern for swimming. However, the cycle periods over which the locomotor rhythm generator could generate appropriate motor activity were lengthened by about 10\% and the mean duration of swimming episodes was increased by approximately 40\%. 6. We therefore propose that the Ca(2+)-dependent K+ current plays an important role in the self-termination of motor activity.},

  abstract = {Bath application of N-methyl-aspartate induces fictive locomotor activity in the isolated spinal cord preparation of the lamprey, as well as TTX-resistant membrane potential oscillations in many individual neurons. This inherent oscillatory activity is shown to depend on a specific activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. This activation initiates voltage-dependent, magnesium- requiring membrane potential bistability, presumably due to a development of a region of negative slope conductance in the current- voltage relation of the neuron. When sodium ions were removed from the bathing solution, oscillations disappeared, and the membrane potential was maintained at a hyperpolarized level, suggesting that the depolarizing current during the oscillatory cycle is mainly carried by sodium ions. Replacing Ca2+ with Ba2+ also leads to a cessation of oscillatory activity, with the membrane potential remaining at the more depolarized level. This indicates an involvement of a Ca2+-dependent K+ current during the repolarization phase. These findings, together with the voltage dependence, can account for the main characteristics of the NMDA receptor-induced, TTX-resistant membrane potential oscillations. This oscillatory behavior has been demonstrated in motoneurons and in several interneurons including CC interneurons but has not been found in edge cells, dorsal cells, or lateral interneurons. The possibility that inherent oscillatory membrane properties may contribute to the activity pattern during fictive locomotion was investigated in experiments with intracellular current injection in the absence of TTX. The stimulation effects obtained required the presence of magnesium ions and were analogous to the stimulation effects seen during oscillations after TTX blockade. Together with similarities in, for instance, frequency and amplitude between the locomotor oscillatory activity and the TTX-resistant oscillations, the results are compatible with an involvement of inherent, oscillatory membrane properties during fictive locomotion in the lamprey spinal cord.},

A minimal ionic model that exhibits postinhibitory rebound (PIR) is presented. When the post-synaptic conductance depends instantaneously on presynaptic potential the classical alternating rhythm is obtained. Using phase-plane analysis we identify two underlying mechanisms, “release” and “escape,” for the out-of-phase oscillation. When the postsynaptic conductance is not instantaneous but decays slowly, the two cells can oscillate synchronously with no phase difference. In each case, different stable activity patterns can coexist over a substantial parameter range.},

  abstract = {We present an ionic conductance model of chattering neurons in the neocortex, which fire fast rhythmic bursts in the gamma frequency range (∼40 Hz) in response to stimulation [Gray C. M. and McCormick D. A. (1996) Science274, 109–113]. The bursting mechanism involves a “ping-pong” interplay between soma-to-dendrite back propagation of action potentials and an afterdepolarization generated by a persistent dendritic Na+ current and a somatic Na+ window current. The oscillation period is primarily determined by a slowly inactivating K+ channel and passive membrane properties. The model behavior is compared quantitatively with the experimental data. It is shown that the cholinergic muscarinic receptor activation can transform the model cell's firing pattern from tonic spiking to rapid bursting, as a possible pathway for acetylcholine to promote 40-Hz oscillations in the visual cortex. To explore possible functions of fast burst firing in the neocortex, a hypothetical neural pair is simulated, where a chattering cell is presynaptic to an inhibitory interneuron via stochastic synapses. For this purpose, we use a synapse model endowed with a low release probability, short-term facilitation and vesicle depletion. This synapse model reproduces the behavior of certain neocortical pyramid-to-interneuron synapses [Thomson A. M.et al. (1993) Neuroscience54, 347–360]. We showed that the burstiness of cell firing is required for the rhythmicity to be reliably transmitted to the postsynaptic cell via unreliable synapses, and that fast burst firing of chattering neurons can provide an exceptionally powerful drive for recruiting feedback inhibition in cortical circuits. From these results, we propose that the fast rhythmic burst firing of neocortical chattering neurons is generated by a calcium-independent ionic mechanism. Our simulation results on the neural pair highlight the importance of characterizing the short-term plasticity of the synaptic connections made by chattering cells, in order to understand their putative pacemaker role in synchronized gamma oscillations of the visual cortex.},

  abstract = {The lamprey central nervous system has been used extensively as a model system for investigating the networks underlying vertebrate motor behavior. The locomotor networks can be activated by application of glutamate agonists, such as N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA), to the isolated spinal cord preparation. Many spinal neurons are capable of generating pacemaker-like membrane potential oscillations upon activation of NMDA receptors. These oscillations rely on the voltage-dependent properties of NMDA receptors in interaction with voltage-dependent potassium and calcium-dependent potassium (KCa) channels, as well as low voltage-activated calcium channels. Upon membrane depolarization, influx of calcium will activate KCa channels, which in turn, will contribute to repolarization and termination of the depolarized phase. The appearance of the NMDA-induced oscillations varies markedly between spinal cord preparations; they may either have a pronounced, depolarized plateau phase or be characterized by a short-lasting depolarization lasting approximately 200–300 ms without a plateau. Both types of oscillations increase in frequency with increased concentrations of NMDA. Here, we characterize these two types of membrane potential oscillations and show that they depend on the level of endogenous release of 5-HT in the spinal cord preparations. In the lamprey, 5-HT acts to block voltage-dependent calcium channels and will thereby modulate the activity of KCa channels. When 5-HT antagonists were administered, the plateau-like oscillations were converted to the second type of oscillations lacking a plateau phase. Conversely, plateau-like oscillations can be induced or prolonged by 5-HT agonists. These properties are most likely of significance for the modulatory action of 5-HT on the spinal networks for locomotion.},

In this review, we define batch effects as unwanted variation introduced by confounding factors that are not related to any factors of interest. Computational and analytical methods are required to remove or account for batch effects. However, inherent microbiome data characteristics (e.g. sparse, compositional and multivariate) challenge the development and application of batch effect adjustment methods to either account or correct for batch effects. We present commonly encountered sources of batch effects that we illustrate in several case studies. We discuss the limitations of current methods, which often have assumptions that are not met due to the peculiarities of microbiome data. We provide practical guidelines for assessing the efficiency of the methods based on visual and numerical outputs and a thorough tutorial to reproduce the analyses conducted in this review.},

We focus on a gLV model of the gut microbiome, in which the evolution of the gut microbial state is determined in part by pairwise interspecies interaction parameters that encode environmentally mediated resource competition between microbes. We develop an in silico method that controls the steady-state outcome of the system by adjusting these interaction parameters. This approach is confined to a bistable region of the gLV model. In this method, a dimensionality reduction technique called steady-state reduction (SSR) is first used to generate a two-dimensional (2D) gLV model that approximates the high-dimensional dynamics on the 2D subspace spanned by the two steady states. Then a bifurcation analysis of the 2D model analytically determines parameter modifications that drive an initial condition to a target steady state. This parameter modification of the reduced 2D model guides parameter modifications of the original high-dimensional model, resulting in a change of steady-state outcome in the high-dimensional model. This control method, called SSR-guided parameter change (SPARC), bypasses the computational challenge of directly determining parameter modifications in the original high-dimensional system. SPARC could guide the development of indirect bacteriotherapies, which seek to change microbial compositions by deliberately modifying gut environmental variables such as gut acidity or macronutrient availability.},

We reexamine the assumptions of existing MR methods and show how they need to be clarified to allow for pervasive horizontal pleiotropy and heterogeneous effect sizes. We propose a comprehensive framework GRAPPLE to analyze the causal effect of target risk factors with heterogeneous genetic instruments and identify possible pleiotropic patterns from data. By using GWAS summary statistics, GRAPPLE can efficiently use both strong and weak genetic instruments, detect the existence of multiple pleiotropic pathways, determine the causal direction and perform multivariable MR to adjust for confounding risk factors. With GRAPPLE, we analyze the effect of blood lipids, body mass index, and systolic blood pressure on 25 disease outcomes, gaining new information on their causal relationships and potential pleiotropic pathways involved.},

Thus, microbiome data are highly susceptible to batch effects, defined as sources of unwanted variation that are not related to and obscure any factors of interest. Existing batch effect correction methods have been primarily developed for gene expression data. As such, they do not consider the inherent characteristics of microbiome data, including zero inflation, overdispersion and correlation between variables. We introduce new multivariate and non-parametric batch effect correction methods based on Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLSDA). PLSDA-batch first estimates treatment and batch variation with latent components, then subtracts batch-associated components from the data. The resulting batch-effect-corrected data can then be input in any downstream statistical analysis. Two variants are proposed to handle unbalanced batch x treatment designs and to avoid overfitting when estimating the components via variable selection. We compare our approaches with popular methods managing batch effects, namely, removeBatchEffect, ComBat and Surrogate Variable Analysis, in simulated and three case studies using various visual and numerical assessments. We show that our three methods lead to competitive performance in removing batch variation while preserving treatment variation, especially for unbalanced batch \$\textbackslash times \$ treatment designs. Our downstream analyses show selections of biologically relevant taxa. This work demonstrates that batch effect correction methods can improve microbiome research outputs.

Mathematical descriptions of the membrane currents were derived using voltage-clamp data collected from entorhinal cortical neurons. A bifurcation analysis was performed using applied current as the control parameter to map the range of magnitudes of the sodium, potassium/cation, and leakage conductances over which subthreshold oscillations exist. The threshold of the potassium/cation current was an important determinant of the robustness of oscillatory behavior. The activation time constant of the potassium/cation current largely determined the frequency range of emergent oscillations. This result implicates the slow inward rectifier or an as yet undescribed slow outward current in entorhinal cortical oscillations; the latter explanation, while more speculative, is more consistent with the pharmacological properties of subthreshold oscillations and gives oscillations over a larger current range. The shallowness of the sodium activation curve confined emergent oscillations to rise gradually rather than abruptly and extended the current range over which the model oscillated.},

  abstract = {We propose and evaluate branch-and-price approaches for vehicle routing problems with picking, loading, and soft time windows. This general type of vehicle routing problem is of particular relevance in the same-day delivery context, in which fast routing algorithms are required because of the commitment to real-time delivery in the presence of high customer order frequencies. To boost the performance of the branch-and-price algorithms, we introduce the new method of tree-compatible labeling with nondominance trees. This method represents cost functions by a fixed number of breakpoints and uses a specialized tree-based data structure to store Pareto-optimal labels. We prove the theoretical soundness of the new method and evaluate its performance numerically with respect to pricing, column generation, and branch-and-price. Our numerical results show that the method yields substantial performance gains. In particular, we show that, with the new method, branch-and-price is able to reliably generate within a few minutes close to optimal solutions for problem instances with 50 customers. By additional experiments with classic vehicle routing problems with hard time windows, we show that the performance gains of our method result from its ability to handle cost functions in the pricing step. Our approach is the first branch-and-price approach for vehicle routing with picking, loading, and soft time windows. As such, it represents an exact routing algorithm that is able to reliably satisfy the runtime requirements of real-time delivery services.Summary of Contribution: In this paper, we propose the first branch-and-price approaches for a general class of vehicle routing problems with picking, loading, and soft time windows. This problem class is of particular importance for real-time delivery services, for which customers expect to be served within only a few hours after their order has been placed. We provide a problem formulation that takes into account that short runtimes of routing algorithms are required, that the upper bounds of the customers' time windows may be violated at a certain cost, and that a significant part of the delivery time window is consumed by picking orders from a warehouse and loading orders into vehicles. Solving the problem with branch-and-price requires the use of cost functions as elements of the labels in the pricing step. We propose a method that approximates these cost functions and leverages the computational performance of nondominance tree data structures for solving the pricing problem. We prove the theoretical soundness of this new method for exact branch-and-price, and we show numerically that the method leads to a significant performance increase of branch-and-price. The paper lies at the intersection of computing and operations research, in particular because our algorithms are designed to leverage the computational performance of advanced data structures for solving a combinatorial optimization problem.},

  abstract = {The accumulation of senescent cells is associated with aging, inflammation and cellular dysfunction. Senolytic drugs can alleviate age-related comorbidities by selectively killing senescent cells. Here we screened 2,352 compounds for senolytic activity in a model of etoposide-induced senescence and trained graph neural networks to predict the senolytic activities of {$>$}800,000 molecules. Our approach enriched for structurally diverse compounds with senolytic activity; of these, three drug-like compounds selectively target senescent cells across different senescence models, with more favorable medicinal chemistry properties than, and selectivity comparable to, those of a known senolytic, ABT-737. Molecular docking simulations of compound binding to several senolytic protein targets, combined with time-resolved fluorescence energy transfer experiments, indicate that these compounds act in part by inhibiting Bcl-2, a regulator of cellular apoptosis. We tested one compound, BRD-K56819078, in aged mice and found that it significantly decreased senescent cell burden and mRNA expression of senescence-associated genes in the kidneys. Our findings underscore the promise of leveraging deep learning to discover senotherapeutics.},

In yeast, epigenetic information is lost over time due to the relocalization of chromatin-modifying proteins to DNA breaks, causing cells to lose their identity, a hallmark of yeast aging. Using a system called ‘‘ICE’’ (inducible changes to the epigenome), we find that the act of faithful DNA repair advances aging at physiological, cognitive, and molecular levels, including erosion of the epigenetic landscape, cellular exdifferentiation, senescence, and advancement of the DNA methylation clock, which can be reversed by OSK-mediated rejuvenation. These data are consistent with the information theory of aging, which states that a loss of epigenetic information is a reversible cause of aging.},

  abstract = {May’s stability theory, which holds that large ecosystems can be stable up to a critical level of complexity, a product of the number of resident species and the intensity of their interactions, has been a central paradigm in theoretical ecology. So far, however, empirically demonstrating this theory in real ecological systems has been a long-standing challenge with inconsistent results. Especially, it is unknown whether this theory is pertinent in the rich and complex communities of natural microbiomes, mainly due to the challenge of reliably reconstructing such large ecological interaction networks. Here we introduce a computational framework for estimating an ecosystem’s complexity without relying on a priori knowledge of its underlying interaction network. By applying this method to human-associated microbial communities from different body sites and sponge-associated microbial communities from different geographical locations, we found that in both cases the communities display a pronounced trade-off between the number of species and their effective connectance. These results suggest that natural microbiomes are shaped by stability constraints, which limit their complexity.},

  abstract = {Background: Growing evidence has shown that alterations in the gut microbiota composition were associated with a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions. However, whether such associations reflect causality remains unknown. We aimed to reveal the causal relationships among gut microbiota, metabolites, and neuropsychiatric disorders including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and schizophrenia (SCZ). Methods: A two-sample bi-directional Mendelian randomization analysis was performed by using genetic variants from genome-wide association studies as instrumental variables for gut microbiota, metabolites, AD, MDD, and SCZ, respectively. Results: We found suggestive associations of host-genetic-driven increase in Blautia (OR, 0.88; 95\%CI, 0.79–0.99; P = 0.028) and elevated γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (0.96; 0.92–1.00; P = 0.034), a downstream product of Blautia-dependent arginine metabolism, with a lower risk of AD. Genetically increased Enterobacteriaceae family and Enterobacteriales order were potentially associated with a higher risk of SCZ (1.09; 1.00–1.18; P = 0.048), while Gammaproteobacteria class (0.90; 0.83–0.98; P = 0.011) was related to a lower risk for SCZ. Gut production of serotonin was potentially associated with an increased risk of SCZ (1.07; 1.00–1.15; P = 0.047). Furthermore, genetically increased Bacilli class was related to a higher risk of MDD (1.07; 1.02–1.12; P = 0.010). In the other direction, neuropsychiatric disorders altered gut microbiota composition. Conclusions: These data for the first time provide evidence of potential causal links between gut microbiome and AD, MDD, and SCZ. GABA and serotonin may play an important role in gut microbiota-host crosstalk in AD and SCZ, respectively. Further investigations in understanding the underlying mechanisms of associations between gut microbiota and AD, MDD, and SCZ are required.},
